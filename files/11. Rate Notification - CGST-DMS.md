\% Completion of construction as on $31^{\text {st }}$ March, 2019
Illustration: where one- fifth (twenty percent) of the construction has been completed, $\mathrm{F}_{4}$ shall be $100 \div 20=5$.

Explanation: "" Completion of construction as on $31^{\text {st }}$ March, 2019" shall be the same as declared to the Real Estate Regulatory Authority in terms of section 4 and section 11 of Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 (16 of 2016) and where the same is not required to be declared to the Real Estate Regulatory Authority, it shall be got determined and certified by an architect registered with the Council of Architecture constituted under the Architects Act, 1972 (20 of 1972) or a chartered engineer registered with the Institution of Engineers (India).
(c) A registered person shall have the option to calculate ' Te ' in the manner prescribed below instead of the manner prescribed in (b) above,-

Te shall be calculated as under:

$$
\mathrm{Te}=\mathrm{Tc}+\mathrm{T} 1+\mathrm{Tr}
$$

Where, -
Tc is the ITC attributable to construction of commercial portion in the REP, calculated as under:
$\mathrm{Tc}=\mathrm{T} 3$ * (carpet area of commercial apartments in the REP/ total carpet area of commercial and residential apartments in the REP);

Wherein
$\mathrm{T} 3=\mathrm{T}-(\mathrm{T} 1+\mathrm{T} 2)$
$\mathrm{T} 1=$ ITC attributable exclusively to construction of commercial portion in the REP
$\mathrm{T} 2=$ ITC attributable exclusively to construction of residential portion in the REP
and
Tr is the ITC attributable to construction of residential portion in the REP which has time of supply on or before 31.03.2019 and which shall be calculated as under,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \operatorname{Tr}=(\mathrm{T} 3+\mathrm{T} 2) * \mathrm{~F}_{1} * \mathrm{~F}_{2} * \mathrm{~F}_{3} * \mathrm{~F}_{4} \\
& \text { or } \\
& \operatorname{Tr}=(\mathrm{T}-\mathrm{T} 1) * \mathrm{~F}_{1} * \mathrm{~F}_{2} * \mathrm{~F}_{3} * \mathrm{~F}_{4}
\end{aligned}
$$

(d) The amounts 'Tx' and 'Te' shall be computed separately for input tax credit of central tax, State tax, Union territory tax and integrated tax.
(e) Where, Tx is positive, i.e. $\mathrm{Te}<\mathrm{T}$, the registered person shall pay, by debit in the electronic credit ledger or electronic cash ledger, an amount equal to the difference between T and Te . Such amount shall form part of the output tax liability of the registered person and the amount shall be furnished in FORM GST DRC- 03.

Explanation: The registered person may file an application in FORM GST DRC- 20, seeking extension of time for the payment of taxes or any amount due or for allowing payment of such taxes or amount in installments in accordance with the provisions of section 80 . The commissioner may issue an order in FORM GST DRC- 21 allowing the taxable person further time to make payment and/or to pay the amount in such monthly installments, not exceeding twenty-four, as he may deem fit.
(f) Where Tx is negative, i.e. $\mathrm{Te}>\mathrm{T}$, the registered person shall be eligible to take ITC on goods and services received on or after $1^{\text {st }}$ April, 2019 for construction of residential portion in the REP, for which he shall not otherwise be eligible, to the extent of difference between Te and T .
(g) The registered person may calculate Tc and utilize credit to the extent of Tc for payment of tax on commercial apartments, till the complete accounting of Tx is carried out and submitted.
(h) Where percentage completion is zero but ITC has been availed on goods and services received for the project on or prior to $31^{\text {st }}$ March, 2019, input tax credit attributable to construction of residential portion which has time of supply on or after $1^{\text {st }}$ April, 2019, shall be calculated and the amount equal to Tx shall be paid or taken credit of, as the case may be, as prescribed above, with the modification that percentage completion for calculation of $\mathrm{F}_{4}$ shall be taken as the percentage completion which, as certified by an architect registered with the Council of Architecture constituted under the Architects Act, 1972 (20 of 1972) or a chartered engineer registered with the Institution of Engineers (India), can be achieved with the input services received and inputs in stock as on $31^{\text {st }}$ March, 2019.

2. Where \% completion as on 31st March, 2019 is zero but invoicing has been done having time of supply before 31st March, 2019, and no input services or inputs have been received as on 31st March, 2019, "Tc" shall be calculated as follows: -
(a) Input tax credit on inputs and input services attributable to construction of residential portion in a REP, which has time of supply on or before $31^{\text {st }}$ March, 2019 may be denoted as Te which shall be calculated as under,
$\mathrm{Te}=\mathrm{Tc}+\mathrm{Tr}$
Where, -
Tc is the ITC attributable to construction of commercial portion in the REP, calculated as under:
$\mathrm{Tc}=\mathrm{Tn} *$ (carpet area of commercial apartments in the REP/ total carpet area of commercial and residential apartments in the REP) and

Tr is the ITC attributable to construction of residential portion in the REP which has time of supply on or before $31^{\text {st }}$ March, 2019 and which shall be calculated as under,
$\mathrm{Tr}=\mathrm{Tn} * \mathrm{~F}_{1} * \mathrm{~F}_{2} * \mathrm{~F}_{3}$
Where, -
Tn= Tax paid on such inputs and input services on which ITC is available under the CGST Act, received in 2019-20 for construction of REP

F1, F2 and F3 shall be the same as in para 1 above
(b) The registered person shall be eligible to take ITC on goods and services received on or after $1^{\text {st }}$ April, 2019 for construction of residential portion in the REP, for which he shall not otherwise be eligible, to the extent of the amount of Te .
(c) The amount ' Te ' shall be computed separately for input tax credit of central tax, State tax, Union territory tax and integrated tax.
3. Notwithstanding anything contained in paragraph 1 or paragraph 2 above, Te shall be determined in the following situations as under:
(i) where percentage invoicing is more than the percentage completion and the difference between percentage invoicing (per cent. points) and the percentage completion (per cent. points) of construction is more than 25 per cent. points; the value of percentage invoicing shall be deemed to be percentage completion plus 25 percent. points;
(ii) where the value of invoices issued on or prior to $31^{\text {st }}$ March, 2019 exceeds the consideration actually received on or prior to $31^{\text {st }}$ March, 2019 by more than 25 per cent. of consideration actually received; the value of such invoices for the purpose of determination of percentage invoicing shall be deemed to beactual consideration received plus 25 percent. of the actual consideration received; and

(iii) where, the value of procurement of inputs and input services prior to $1^{\text {st }}$ April, 2019 exceeds the value of actual consumption of the inputs and input services used in the percentage of construction completed as on $31^{\text {st }}$ March, 2019 by more than 25 percent. of value of actual consumption of inputs and input services, the jurisdictional commissioner or any other officer authorized in this regard may fix the Te based on actual per unit consumption of inputs and input services based on the documents duly certified by a chartered accountant or cost accountant submitted by the promoter in this regard, applying the accepted principles of accounting.

In this example, the promoter has procured 80 per cent. of goods and services [other than services by way of grant of development rights, long term lease of land (against upfront payment in the form of premium, salami, development charges etc.) or FSI (including additional FSI), electricity, high speed diesel, motor spirit, natural gas], from a GST registered person. However, he has procured cement from an unregistered supplier. Hence at the end of financial year, the promoter has to pay GST on cement at the applicable rates on reverse charge basis.

In this example, the promoter has procured 80 per cent. of goods and services including cement from a GST registered person.

In this example, the promoter has procured 50 per cent. of goods and services from a GST registered person. However, he has procured sand, cement and aluminum windows, ply and commercial wood etc. from an unregistered supplier. Thus, value of goods and services procured from registered suppliers during a financial year falls short of threshold limit of 80 per cent. To fulfill his tax liability on the shortfall of 30 per cent. from mandatory purchase, the promoter has to pay GST on cement at the applicable rate on reverse charge basis. After payment of GST on cement, on the remaining shortfall of 15 per cent., the promoter shall pay tax @ 18 $(9+9)$ per cent. under RCM.
