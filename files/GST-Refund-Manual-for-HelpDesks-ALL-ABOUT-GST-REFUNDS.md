# MESSAGE 

As we mark the $3^{\text {rd }}$ Anniversary of GST on this $1^{\text {st }}$ of July 2020, in these somber times when the country and most of the world is battling with the COVID-19 crisis that has disrupted and unsettled normal activity all across, it is imperative that we remain alive to the important matter of bringing the economic activity back on track as soon as can be. It is going to take some effort, but is something that can be achieved and has to be done.

As an organisation, the CBIC is always willing to stand in support all taxpayers in matters relating to tax compliance. Making refund payments in time is one of the ways in which we as a Department can help to some extent in ameliorating the pains that the pandemic has brought on- and we remain proactive in that direction in this Zone. We also operate very active Help Desks on GST running across the State which have remained functioning even during the times of the lockdown. In these times of social distancing and work from home, the reply to queries through the New "Whatsapp Seva" (on +919480258909) appears to have got even more traction with the taxpayers in Karnataka. The GST Help Centre at the Headquarters at the CR Building in Bengaluru was certified as an ISO: 9000 compliant centre and remains fully committed to meet the standards laid down.

As one more step towards taxpayer facilitation, I am happy to note that the Directorate General of Taxpayer Services, Bengaluru and the CGST Bengaluru Zone together have brought out a manual on refund processes titled "All about Refunds". This is a comprehensive guide on all matters relating to GST refunds and should be a useful reference for our officers at the GST Helpdesks, the Taxpayers, the Tax Practitioners, and other tax professionals across the board.

We wish all of you to Stay Safe and Stay Healthy and that we should see the end of this crisis sooner than later.

These are different and difficult times for our country and its citizens as it is for many other countries affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. No sector or segment of economy has remained unaffected by the pandemic which had an impact all across at every level of economic activity in the country. We, at the CBIC remain committed to support our taxpayers and the businesses in every possible way to deal with the present crisis. Over the past three months or so, there have been slew of steps and measures announced by the Government to help ease the situation for trade and industry as also to help tackle the pandemic. The measures have ranged across reductions in rate of tax in Customs on equipments needed to fight the crisis as also advancing the timelines for GST compliances. Technology has been leveraged by the Department to enable our officers' work from home to deal with important issues like the refund claims and also to conduct personal hearings online. We remain committed to be responsive to the taxpayers concerns and their needs. I would like to wish you all to stay safe \& healthy.

# Prologue 

July 1st, 2020, will mark the third anniversary of the Goods and Services Tax in India. There was an air of great anticipation with the ushering in of what was widely accepted to be an important achievement for the whole country. The GST came into force at midnight amid a historic midnight session in the Central Hall of Parliament. President Shri Pranab Mukherjee, Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, and the Finance Minister Shri Arun Jaitley addressed the joint gathering of the Parliamentarians from both houses, before the President and the Prime Minister pressed a button to mark the launch of GST. A midnight joint parliamentary session is rare - the only two times that the event took place before was to mark the occasion of the $50^{\text {th }}$ anniversary of the Quit India movement in 1992, and then to mark the $50^{\text {th }}$ anniversary of Independence Day.

With GST, India moved on to a new framework that subsumed 17 earlier taxes and surcharges - 8 from the Centre and 9 from the States - and in combining them in on a single tax base. The levy that happens now in GST is on a transaction of 'supply' is either in the form of a [Central Goods and Service Tax, CGST+ State Goods and Service Tax, SGST] combination for intrastate transactions or as an Integrated Goods and Service Tax, [IGST] for interstate transactions.

Though the COVID- 19 pandemic has been an event of unprecedented disruption and difficulty all through and led to many changes in the way we live and work. Social distancing, masks, frequent hand washes are now a way of life and important enough as instruments in protecting self and fellow citizens. In GST, the areas of taxpayer refunds and registration have been areas of focus and now even more. This is an attempt to collate and put together a compilation on all matters relating to refunds that we hope would be useful to the GST HelpDesks, to taxpayers, tax professionals, and indeed for any person who has an interest in gaining an in-depth look at the matters concerned. Capacity building and enablement at the Help Centres remain a central theme in our focus to bring better taxpayer services and putting this manual/ reference together is our way to record our appreciation for the

efforts put in by the taxpayers to generate the revenue needed for the Country's growth, development and to keep it safe. This is also our humble contribution to mark the efforts of all the officers at the HelpDesks who engage with the taxpayers often as the first point of contact through phone, messages, and emails and who would be working today to mark the completion of three years of the GST in our country.

I would also like to gratefully acknowledge the suggestions and inputs received from Shri D.P. Nagendra Kumar, Principal Chief Commissioner (GST), Bengaluru and Shri Upender Gupta, Principal Commissioner, Air Cargo (Import), Delhi Customs in the making of this compilation.

A special note of acknowledgement and recognition to the contribution of Ms. Sabrina Cano, Superintendent working with the Principal Chief Commissioner's Office (Central Tax- Bengaluru), who has in her usual quiet way, shared the responsibility and exerted a substantial effort in putting together this Manual.

Please do write to us to point out any errors or omissions that you may notice in this "All About GST Refunds" reference manual - mail us at dgtsbangalore@gov.in or to ccbz-excise@gov.in with the subject line "All about GST Refunds".

# Introduction 

Goods and Services Tax (GST) in India, is a form of a Value-Added Tax (VAT). The overarching purpose of GST was to impose a broad-based tax on Consumption. It is a destination-based consumption tax.

The existing taxes before GST operated under the origin principle - the jurisdiction where the taxable activity took place levied and collected the tax. Origin based taxation created a scope at the sub-national level for a State to either export taxes onto other states or to undermine the companion State's tax base by undercutting the tax rates charged elsewhere. Levying VAT on an origin basis, as it was happening in VAT before GST meant that taxes were being charged on the value that was added to a product in a different jurisdiction, at the rates charged by those jurisdictions which could well have been different from the rates in the destination states. The Firms producing in multiple jurisdictions then had an incentive to transfer price value-added into low tax jurisdictions, for instance by charging high internal prices for intrafirm sales out of them.

The change in GST to the destination principle places all firms competing in a given jurisdiction on an even footing. Thus, the tax paid on any taxable supply made under GST is determined by a set of rules to decide where this tax revenue will be destined to. These ground rules are contained in Sections 8 through 14 of the Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST) Act, 2017 that determine the nature and the place of consumption for every transaction of 'supply'. All revenues in GST accrue to the jurisdiction where the supply is said to be consumed. There is a widespread consensus now that the destination principle, with revenue accruing to the country (and at a sub-national level to the State/UT) where the final consumption occurs, is preferable to the origin principle from both a theoretical and practical standpoint.

The GST has unified the tax base at the Federal and the sub-national level in the Indian context. This has happened through uniformity of laws, tax rates, and the adoption of a single taxable event across both national and subnational levels. The taxable event in Indian GST is that of 'supply' which is

more broad-based than any single taxable event like manufacture or sale, in the taxes that it replaced. In GST, we have managed to achieve compliance symmetry (Identical compliance requirement for inter- and intra-provincial traders) - it was desirable to have such a compliance symmetry to have significant cost savings and efficiency at the firm level and thereby, at an aggregate level for the nation.

In general, the GST is imposed at every stage of the economic process and a deduction of taxes on purchases is allowed by all but the final consumer. The mechanism of input tax credits through the supply chain, except by the final consumer, ensures the neutrality of the tax, whatever the nature of the product, the structure of the distribution chain, and the means used for its delivery (e.g. retail stores, physical delivery, Internet downloads). There is a clear mechanism in place that allows for a credit of the tax levied on transactions between businesses. The system is based on tax collection in a staged process, with successive businesses entitled to deduct input tax on "capital goods", "inputs" or "input services" and account for a tax on "outward supplies". As a result of the staged payment system, GST thereby "flows through the businesses" to tax supplies made to final consumers. Following the destination principle, in GST exports are not subject to tax with a refund of input taxes (that is "zero-rated") being made available, but imports are taxed (through the impost of an Integrated Goods and Services Tax -IGST) on the same basis and at the same rates as domestic supplies. These features give GST one of its main characteristics, that of neutrality.

This destination principle is sanctioned by the World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. In the predecessor GATT System that existed before the WTO, addenda to Article XVI of the 1947 General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT) excluded explicitly that such an exemption could be considered a subsidy: The exemption of an exported product from duties or taxes borne by the like product when destined for domestic consumption or the remission of such duties or taxes in amounts not over those which have accrued were not deemed to be a subsidy. Consequently, Article 6.4 of the 1947 General Agreement stipulated that: No product of the territory of any contracting party imported into the territory of any other contracting party shall be

subject to ... countervailing duty by reason of [such exemptions or refunds]. This principle was not changed within the framework of the WTO system, since Article I of the Uruguay Round Subsidies Agreement, which defines a subsidy, stipulates once again in footnote 1 that: the exemption of an exported product from duties or taxes borne by the like product when destined for domestic consumption or the remission of such duties or taxes in amounts not in excess of those which have accrued, shall not be deemed to be a subsidy1.

In GST law, the Integrated Goods and Service Tax (IGST) Act, 2017, in Chapter VII deals with the ZERO RATED SUPPLY. Section 16 of the IGST Act defines a "zero-rated supply" to mean any of the following supplies of goods or services or both, namely:-
(a) Export of goods or services or both; or
(b) Supply of goods or services or both to a Special Economic Zone developer or a Special Economic Zone unit.

The credit of input tax can also be availed for making zero-rated supplies subject to the provisions of sub-section (5) of section 17 of the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 (CGST Act). Under the provisions of section 54 of the Central Goods and Services Tax Act any person registered under GST and making zero-rated supply is eligible to claim a refund under either of the following options: -
(a) He may supply goods or services or both under bond or Letter of Undertaking, without payment of integrated tax and claim refund of the unutilised input tax credit; or
(b) He may supply goods or services or both, on payment of integrated tax and claim a refund of such tax paid on goods or services or both supplied.

More generally, the following kinds of Refunds are available to eligible taxpayers under GST:
i. A refund of tax paid on zero-rated supplies of goods or services or both or on inputs or input services used in making such zero-rated supplies,

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ AGREEMENT ON SUBSIDIES AND COUNTERVAILING MEASURES| https://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/24-scm.pdf

ii. A Refund of tax on the supply of goods regarded as deemed exports,
iii. A refund of the unutilized input tax credit.

# 'Supply' in GST 

In GST, the taxable event is the event of a "Supply". In ordinary language, supply means make (something needed or wanted) available to someone; to provide. Supply could be an interstate supply or an intrastate one.

The GST is levied in the form of a Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST) and a State or Union Territory Goods and Services Tax (SGST or UTGST) on all intra-State supplies of goods or services or both, except on the supply of alcoholic liquor for human consumption. The value taken for the charge of the tax is determined under Section 15 of the CGST Act and the tax is calculated at such rates, not exceeding twenty percent, as may be notified by the Government on the recommendations of the Council. An Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST) is levied instead of a Central Goods and Services Tax and a State or Union Territory Goods and Services Tax whenever the supply happens to be an interstate one.

In terms of Section 7 of the CGST Act that deals with the "Scope of Supply", "supply" includes all forms of supply of goods or services or both such as sale, transfer, barter, exchange, licence, rental, lease or disposal made or agreed to be made for a consideration by a person in the course or furtherance of business. Thus, the general tests for a transaction to be reckoned as a supply or not are two - the first being the Business Test (whether the supply is made in the course or furtherance of business) AND the Second is the Test of the Consideration for the particular supply concerned in the transaction that may have been made or agreed to be made. However, in GST law, the Business Test mentioned above does not apply to the situation of import of services for a consideration. Any Import of Services thus become liable to tax whether or not made in the course or furtherance of business. Besides, there is a set of activities specified in Schedule I to the CGST Act, made or agreed to be made without any consideration, that if engaged in have to be construed as being an instance of a 'supply'.

Schedule II to the CGST Act contains a listing of activities or transactions that constitute a supply in the sense of the meaning assigned to the expression but

are to be treated either as a supply of goods or supply of services to ease the matters relating to the determination of the place of supply and matters relating to the rate of tax attracted on the particular transactions.

Furthermore, Activities or transactions specified in Schedule III to the CGST Act; or such activities or transactions undertaken by the Central Government, a State Government or any local authority in which they are engaged as public authorities, as may be notified by the Government on the recommendations of the Council are to be treated neither as a supply of goods nor a supply of services.

# Input Tax Credits in GST 

Chapter V of the CGST Act deals with Input Tax Credit (ITC).
Section 16 of the CGST Act entitles every registered person to take credit of input tax charged on any supply (of goods or services or both) to him which are used or intended to be used in the course or furtherance of his business.

Credit is permitted to be taken on 'capital goods', 'inputs', and on 'input services'. The entitlement to credit is subject to certain prescribed conditions and restrictions. The ITC is made available to the registered person as a credit in his electronic credit ledger. To take credit, the registered person should have a tax invoice or debit note (or any other prescribed taxpaying documents) issued by a GST registered supplier and he should also have received the goods or services or both on which the ITC is sought to be taken. Section 49 of the CGST Act deals with how the input tax credit is credited to the electronic credit ledger of the registered taxpayer.

The CGST law - Section 16 (2) (c) \& (d) also entails that before the ITC is taken by the Recipient of either goods or services or both, the tax charged in respect of such input supplies should have been actually paid to the Government, either in cash or through utilization of input tax credit admissible in respect of the such a supply; and that the supplier making the input supplies furnish the return under section 39 .

In terms of the $1^{\text {st }}$, and $2^{\text {nd }}$ Provisos to Section 16(2)(c) of the CGST Act, where the goods against an invoice are received in lots or installments, the registered person is entitled to take credit upon receipt of the last lot or installment. Besides, it is also stipulated that the recipient of input supplies (either goods or services or both) should pay the amount towards the value of supply along with tax payable thereon within a period of one hundred and eighty days from the date of issue of invoice by the supplier of goods or services or both, other than the supplies on which tax is payable on reverse charge basis- in case, the stipulated payments are not made in this time of 180 days an amount equal to

the input tax credit availed by the recipient would be added to his output tax liability of the recipient, along with interest thereon.
The $3^{\text {rd }}$ Proviso to Section 16(2) (c) of the CGST Act deals with the reverse charge situations and provides that the recipient of goods and services or both, is entitled to avail of the credit of input tax on payment made by him of the amount towards the value of supply of goods or services or both along with tax payable thereon.

Section 16 (3) of the CGST Act disallows the registered person from claiming input tax credit on the tax component of the cost of capital goods and plant and machinery that has been claimed as depreciation on under the provisions of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (43 of 1961). Section 16 (4) permits input tax credit in respect of any invoice or debit note for the supply of goods or services or both but puts a timeline within which such a credit can be taken.

The amount of input tax credit is restricted to so much of the input tax as is attributable to the purposes of his business - in cases where the goods or services or both are used by the registered person partly for any business and partly for other purposes [Section 17(1) of the CGST Act] - this is a practice consistent with the laws and practices in many other tax jurisdictions outside India which follow GST/ VAT models. In cases where the goods or services or both are used by the registered person partly for effecting taxable supplies including zero-rated supplies and partly for effecting exempt supplies under the said Acts, the amount of credit is restricted to the input tax as can be attributed to the said taxable supplies including zero-rated supplies [Section 17(2) of the CGST Act]. The value of exempt supply can be worked out using [Section 17(3) of the CGST Act]. Section 17(4) of the CGST Act gives two options on the manner of taking ITC, either one of which may be exercised, to a banking company or a financial institution including a non-banking financial company, engaged in supplying services by way of accepting deposits, extending loans or advances.

Section 17 (5) restricts the input tax credit from being available in respect of certain input supplies - like on certain classes of motor vehicles, vessels, and aircraft, on food and beverages, outdoor catering, beauty treatment, health

services, cosmetic and plastic surgery, life insurance, etc. However, some of these exclusions are not absolute and there are specific situations in which ITC can be taken on some such supplies.

Section 18 of the CGST Act makes input tax credit available in respect of inputs and capital goods sent for a job-work, subject to observance of stipulated conditions.

Section 20 of the CGST Act deals with the manner of distribution of credit by an "Input Service Distributor".

The framework of the input tax credit mechanism outlined above applies to all three taxes in GST - the central tax, the integrated tax, and the State Tax.

# Exports in GST 

In terms of Section 2 (5) of the IGST Act, "export of goods" with its grammatical variations and cognate expressions, means taking goods out of India to a place outside India. An "export of services" in terms of Section 2(6) of the IGST Act means the supply of any service when, -
(i) The supplier of service is located in India;
(ii) The recipient of service is located outside India
(iii) The place of supply of service is outside India
(iv) The payment for such service has been received by the supplier of service in convertible foreign exchange [or in Indian rupees wherever permitted by the Reserve Bank of India]; and
(v) The supplier of service and the recipient of service are not merely establishments of a distinct person

In GST certain establishments are treated as establishments of distinct persons where a person has -
(i) An establishment in India and any other establishment outside India;
(ii) An establishment in a State or Union territory and any other establishment outside that State or Union territory; or
(iii) An establishment in a State or Union territory and any other establishment registered within that State or Union territory.

The location of the supplier of service, the location of the recipient of service, and the place of supply of service are determinable in terms of Sections 2(15) and Section 2(14) of the IGST Act. In cases where the location of the supplier or location of the recipient is outside India, the place of supply of the concerned service can be determined with reference to provisions of Section 13 of the IGST Act.

# Zero-rated supplies under GST 

Export of goods or services or both, and the supply of goods or services or both, to a Special Economic Zone developer or a Special Economic Zone unit are zero-rated as per Section 16(1)(a) \& (b) respectively of the IGST Act, 2017.

By zero-rating it is meant that the tax impact on the entire supply chain leading up to the particular transaction that is being "Zero Rated" is made tax free i.e. there is no burden of tax to be borne either on the inputs leading up to the particular outward supply or on the outward supply itself. [In terms of Section 2 (83) of the CGST Act 2017, "outward supply" in relation to a taxable person, means a supply of goods or services or both, whether by sale, transfer, barter, exchange, licence, rental, lease or disposal or any other mode, made or agreed to be made by such person in the course or furtherance of business.]

Zero- rating in GST implies the following: -
i. The credit of input tax may be availed for making zero-rated supplies; notwithstanding that such supply may be an exempt supply (note: credit eligibility still needs to be checked with reference to terms of provisions of Chapter V of the CGST Act, 2017).
ii. A registered person making zero rated supply shall be eligible to claim refund in accordance with the provisions of section 54 of the CGST Act under either of the following options, namely :-
(a) he may supply goods or services or both under bond or Letter of Undertaking, without payment of integrated tax and claim refund of unutilised input tax credit; or
(b) he may supply goods or services or both, on payment of integrated tax and claim refund of such tax paid on goods or services or both supplied.

The Zero- Rated situations can be contrasted with the other situation where a particular supply under the GST has been exempted from the charge of the tax - in the latter situation, it is only that the outward supply or the output that is

exempted from tax, but the tax borne on all the inputs that may have gone into making this outward supply is not refunded. The essence of zero-rating is thus, to make Indian goods and services competitive in the international market by ensuring that domestic taxes do not get added as a cost in exports.

The objective of zero-rating of exports and supplies to SEZ/SEZ Developer is achieved through the provision contained in Section 16(3) of the IGST Act, 2017.

# Refund in GST 

When tax, interest, or any other amount is paid to the Government more than the liability incurred or accrued, then a refund situation arises. In terms of the explanation to Section 54 of the CGST Act, "refund" includes a refund of tax paid on zero-rated supplies of goods or services or both or on inputs or input services used in making such zero-rated supplies, or refund of tax on the supply of goods regarded as deemed exports, or refund of the unutilized input tax credit.

## Statutory provisions relating to refunds in GST

Chapter XI of the CGST Act, 2017, in Sections 54 to 56 deal with refunds under GST. The procedure for claiming refunds is contained in Chapter X of the CGST Rules, 2017 under Rules 89 to 97A.

## GST Council Resolution on permitting refunds without matching and without excluding the amount of provisionally accepted input tax credit

Since the functionality of furnishing of FORM GSTR-2 and FORM GSTR-3 remains unimplemented, it has been decided by the GST Council to sanction refund of provisionally accepted input tax credit. However, the applicants applying for refund must give an undertaking to the effect that the amount of refund sanctioned would be paid back to the Government with interest in case it is found subsequently that the requirements of clause (c) of sub-section (2) of section 16 read with sub-section (2) of section 42 of the CGST Act have not been complied with in respect of the amount refunded. This undertaking should be submitted electronically along with the refund claim

The concerned portion of the Minutes of 24th GST Council Meeting held on 16 December 2017 is reproduced below:

# Agenda item 3: 

Any other agenda item with the permission of the Chairperson

## (i) Refund of provisionally accepted input tax credit

8. Introducing this agenda item, the Secretary stated that as no automated refund system had been operationalised as yet, the refund applications were being filed online and then the applicants would take a hard copy of the same to the jurisdictional officer for processing the refund claim manually, after which a single order would be passed. He stated that some officers in the field had raised a doubt that as per the law, refund could be given only if the inward and outward supplies were matched and tax was paid on the supply. He stated that as presently no matching was possible, it was proposed to take an undertaking as part of refund application itself that the amount of refund would be paid back to the Government in case it was subsequently found that the tax had not been paid on the supply as required under Section 16(2)(c) of the CGST Act/SGST Act or the inward and the outward supply involving the refund claim did not match (requirements under Sections 41 and 42 of CGST/SGST Act). He stated that it was proposed to allow following refunds (both provisional and final) without matching and without excluding the amount of provisionally accepted input tax credit: (i) Unutilised input tax credit in case of zero rated supplies (exports and supplies to SEZs) of goods or services or both; (ii) Unutilised input tax credit in case of inverted duty structure in case of goods (including supply of goods to merchant exporters); (iii) IGST paid on zero rated supplies (exports and supplies to SEZs) of goods or services or both; (iv) IGST or CGST/SGST/UTGST paid on deemed export of goods subject to furnishing an undertaking as part of refund application itself that the amount of refund would be paid back to the Government in case it is found subsequently that the requirement of Section 16(2)(c) read with Section 42 (2) of the CGST/SGST Act have not been complied with. He stated that this relaxation was proposed by exercising the power conferred under Section 148 of the CGST/SGST Act regarding special procedure for certain processes.

8.1. The Hon'ble Minister from West Bengal strongly supported the proposal. He stated that since GSTR-2 stood suspended, no matching of inward .and outward supply was possible, and therefore, it was a very good proposal to permit refund without matching. The Hon'ble Minister from Tamil Nadu had circulated a written speech in which it was mentioned that Section 148 of the CGST/SGST Act had no non-obstante ("notwithstanding clause") and hence, it needed to be examined whether the special process prescribed under Section 148 would over-ride the substantive provision of Section 54(6) of the CGST/SGST Act which required that any claim for refund on account of zero rated supply of goods or services or both made by registered persons be refunded on a provisional basis to the extent of $90 \%$ of the total amount so claimed, excluding the amount of input tax credit provisionally accepted. In the written speech, he also pointed out that refund based on GSTR-3B returns might lead to bogus claim of input tax credit by unscrupulous taxpayers taking advantage of non-matching of input tax credit. He suggested to stipulate sufficient safeguards for the revenue as well as for the Departmental officers. In view of this, he recommended that the matter be examined in further detail as it involved substantial question of law. However, the Hon'ble Minister from Tamil Nadu did not express these apprehensions during the Council Meeting. No other Member expressed any reservation on the proposal. The Hon'ble Chairperson suggested that the proposal made by the Secretary could be approved. The Council approved the same.
9. for agenda item 3(i), the Council approved the following:
a. to allow following refunds (both provisional and final) without matching and without excluding the amount of provisionally accepted input tax credit: (i) Unutilised input tax credit in case of zero rated supplies (exports and supplies to SEZs) of goods or services or both; (ii) Unutilised input tax credit in case of inverted duty structure in case of goods (including supply of goods to merchant exporters); (iii) IGST paid on zero rated supplies (exports and supplies to SEZs) of goods or services or both; (iv) IGST or CGST/SGST/UTGST paid on deemed export of goods.
b. Such refund shall be given subject to furnishing an undertaking as part of refund application itself that the amount of refund would be paid back

to the Government in case it is found subsequently that the requirement of Section 16(2)(c) read with Section 42 (2) of the CGST/SGST Act have not been complied with in respect of the amount refunded

# Time limits to claim a refund in GST 

The time limit for claiming a refund is two years from the relevant date. However, in terms of the Explanation to Section 54, the 'relevant date' or the reference date is different for different situations as indicated in the following table: -

Table 1
![img-7.jpeg](img-7.jpeg.png)

|  |  | refund arises |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| $\mathbf{6}$ | Refund of tax paid provisionally | Date of adjustment of tax <br> after the final assessment |
| $\mathbf{7}$ | Refund claimed by a person other than the supplier | Date of receipt of goods or <br> services or both by such <br> person |
| $\mathbf{8}$ | In any other case | Date of payment of tax |

A refund application filed after correction of deficiency is treated as a fresh refund application, and such a rectified refund application, submitted after correction of deficiencies, will also have to be submitted within 2 years of the relevant date as defined in the explanation after sub-section (14) of section 54 of the CGST Act.
![img-8.jpeg](img-8.jpeg.png)

In wake of COVID pandemic, date further extended till 31.08.2020 for certain compliance under GST laws and till 30.09.2020 for certain compliance Customs, Central Excise and Service Tax Laws - https://www.cbic.gov.in/htdocs-cbec/home_links/tickers as of 30.6.2020 at 19:30 hours

# The Refund Mechanism in GST 

After the rollout of GST w.e.f. 1-7-2017, on account of the unavailability of electronic refund module on the common portal, a temporary mechanism had to be devised and implemented wherein applicants were required to file the refund application in FORM GST RFD-01A on the common portal, take a print out of the same and submit it physically to the jurisdictional tax office along ith all supporting documents. Further processing of these refund applications, i.e. issuance of acknowledgment of the refund application, issuance of deficiency memo, the passing of provisional/final order, payment advice, etc., was also being done manually.

RULE 97A of the CGST Rules had enabled the Manual filing and processing of refund claims- It states that notwithstanding anything contained in CHAPTER X of the CGST Rules 2017, dealing with REFUND and with respect to any process or procedure prescribed for refunds, any reference to electronic filing of an application, intimation, reply, declaration, statement or electronic issuance of a notice, order or certificate on the common portal shall, in respect of that process or procedure, include manual filing of the said application, intimation, reply, declaration, statement or issuance of the said notice, order or certificate in the concerned Forms as appended were appended to the CGST rules.

To make the process of submission of the refund application electronic, Circular No. 79/53/2018-GST, dated 31-12-2018 was issued wherein it was specified that the refund application in FORM GST RFD-01A, along with all supporting documents, is to be made electronically on the GST portal. However, various post submission stages of processing of the refund application continued to be manual.

The necessary capabilities for making the refund procedure fully electronic, in which all steps of submission and processing were undertaken electronically, was deployed on the common portal with effect from 26-9-2019 - the refund from this date on is processed by a single tax authority, in contrast to the earlier treatment where the claim was processed for the State or the Central

part by the concerned tax agency and processed by the disbursement was processed by the accounting departments of state and central individually.

The refund mechanism under GST is now fully automated. Barring the refund of IGST paid on the export of goods, the following types of refunds are dealt with under the provisions of Rule 89 of the CGST Rules.

With effect from 26-9-2019, the claim in respect of the following types of refund is now to be filed online on the GST Portal in Form GST RFD 01 and is processed electronically:
(a) Refund of unutilized input tax credit (ITC) on account of exports without payment of tax.
(b) Refund of tax paid on export of services with payment of tax.
(c) Refund of unutilized ITC on account of supplies made to SEZ Unit/SEZ Developer without payment of tax.
(d) Refund of tax paid on supplies made to SEZ Unit/SEZ Developer with payment of tax.
(e) Refund of unutilized ITC on account of accumulation due to an inverted tax structure.
(f) Refund to a supplier of tax paid on deemed export supplies.
(g) Refund to a recipient of tax paid on deemed export supplies.
(h) Refund of excess balance in the electronic cash ledger.
(i) Refund of excess payment of tax.
(j) Refund of tax paid on an intra-State supply which is subsequently held to be inter-State supply and vice versa.
(k) Refund on account of assessment / provisional assessment/appeal/any other order.
(l) Refund on account of "any other" ground or reason.

In case an exporter makes supplies of goods out of India on payment of integrated tax, the refund process is governed by Rule 96 of the GST Rules. The refund in such cases shall be processed by the system

designated by the Customs Department. This does not apply to the export of services out of India.

In all other cases, the refund application shall be processed by the proper officers under GST from the Centre or the State Tax Administration.

# Refund of IGST paid on Export of Goods 

The case of a refund of the IGST paid on exports of goods is dealt with under Rule 96 of the CGST Rules, 2017. The most important point here is that there is no specific form that needs to be filled out for claiming refund of IGST paid on export of goods- As per Rule 96(1) of the CGST Rules, 2017, the shipping bill filed by an exporter of goods shall be deemed to be an application for refund of IGST paid on the goods exported out of India.

Such an application is deemed to have been filed only when:
i. The person in charge of the conveyance carrying the export goods duly files an export manifest or an export report covering the number and the date of shipping bills or bills of export; and
ii. The applicant has furnished a valid return in FORM GSTR-3 or FORM GSTR-3B, as the case may be. The term valid return means a return furnished under section 39(1) of the GST Act, 2017 on which self-assessed tax has been paid in full.

Filing of a correct EGM is a must for treating the shipping bill or bill of export as a refund claim. The details of the relevant export invoices contained in FORM GSTR-1 are transmitted electronically by the GST portal to the Customs system and the said system, in turn, transmits back to the GST portal a confirmation that the goods covered by the said invoices have been exported out of India.

Filing of a valid return in GSTR 3B is another pre-condition for considering the shipping bill/bill of export as the claim for refund. Upon receipt of information regarding furnishing of a valid return in FORM GSTR-3B from the common portal the Customs System, processes the claim for refund and an amount equal to the integrated tax paid in respect of each shipping bill or bill of export is electronically credited to the bank account of the applicant mentioned in the taxpayer exporter's registration particulars. Shipping Bill formats (both manual/ electronic) have been modified to make them congruent with the requirements of the IGST law.

In cases where the exporter has filed the GSTR 3B and the information furnished by the exporter in the returns GSTR 1 and GSTR 3B matches with the details filed by them in the Shipping Bills, the refunds are disbursed to the bank account of the exporter.
![img-9.jpeg](img-9.jpeg.png)

Remember to file your GSTR 3B and the GSTR 1 details in time; ensure that the details entered in these returns concerning what has been claimed as Exports matches with the details declared in the Shipping Bills- this will ensure that there are no unnecessary hitches in the clearance of your claims for refunds by the Customs Authority concerned.

IGST Refund module for exports is operational in ICES since 10.10.2017. The procedure for refund of IGST paid on export of goods under Rule 96 of CGST Rules, 2017 for all EDI locations, was provided vide instruction 15/2017Customs, dated 9-10-2017 issued from F. No. 450/119/2017-Cus IV. The IGST refund module has been designed in line with the Rule 96 of the CGST Rules and has an in built mechanism to automatically grant refund after validating the Shipping Bill data with available in ICES against the GST Returns data transmitted by GSTN. The matching between the two data sources is done at Invoice level and any mis-match of the laid down parameters returns following error/response codes:

| Code | Meaning |
| :-- | :-- |
| SB000 | Invoice successfully validated |
| SBV00 | SB already validated successfully |
| SB001 | Invalid SB details |
| SB002 | EGM not filed |
| SB003 | GSTIN mismatch |
| SB004 | Invoice already received and validated |
| SB005 | Invalid Invoice Number |
| SB006 | Gateway EGM not available |

If the necessary matching is successful, ICES shall process the claim for refund and the relevant amount of IGST paid with respect to each Shipping Bill or Bill of export shall be electronically credited to the exporter's bank account as mentioned with the Customs authorities
M.F. (D.R.) Instruction No. 20/2018-Cus., dated 26-11-2018 issued from F. No. 450/119/2017-Cus. IV (Pt-I) deals with the Refund of IGST paid on exports of goods done from Non-EDI sites. The facility to disburse IGST refund of goods exported from Non-EDI locations is provided by DG (Systems). The procedure for processing IGST refund claims for exports made from Non-EDI sites, indicated in this Instruction, are:
(i) Firstly, the export data is to be captured using offline utilities and transmitted by the field formations to DG (Systems) by email.
(ii) The data is then uploaded for verification and final submission by the Customs officer in ICES at the nearest EDI site.
(iii) The refund scroll is then generated for the verified SBs after these are matched with the GST Returns data received from GSTN;
(iv) A public inquiry has been made available on ICEGATE website for checking the details and IGST status of manual SBs verified in ICES.
(v) Specific IGST related errors or mismatches can also be checked by an importer/Customs Broker for his SBs using his ICEGATE login.
(vi) It is only when a SB is verified by the Customs officer in ICES does it become ready for the IGST validation procedure.

# The Error Codes explained 

## (i) SB000: Successfully Validated

This response code comes when all the decided parameters like GSTIN, SB number, Invoice Number etc. match between GSTN and Customs databases. This code implies that the SB is ripe for inclusion in the IGST refund scroll.

However, it might happen that even with SB000, the SB does not appear in the refund scroll. This could be due to:
a) The exports might have been made under bond or LUT, hence not liable for refund.
b) If a shipping bill covers multiple invoices, few of the invoices might have been successfully validated with code SB000 whereas other invoices might be stuck with any of the other errors.
c) Higher rate of Drawback has been claimed for that SB, thus making the SB ineligible for IGST refund.
d) Where the IGST claim amount is less than Rs. 1000/-.

In all the above cases, the scroll amount (check SB Wise IGST Claimed Status Report) shall automatically become zero and the SBs shall not be included in the refund scroll. There are two more reasons where the SBs will figure in the Temporary IGST Scroll but not in the Final Scroll. This could happen if there is an alert/suspension on the IEC in ICES or if the account of the IEC is not validated by PFMS. These cases have been elaborated below.

In respect of (a) above, there may be cases that the exporter has erroneously declared exports under LUT or zero IGST amount paid in the Shipping Bill while actually having declared and paid it in the GST Returns. Such cases can be dealt with through the officer interface.

# (ii) SB001: Invalid Shipping Bill Number 

This may occur due to a mismatch between the SB No. furnished in GSTR$1 / 6 \mathrm{~A}$ and the SB No. with customs. The possible reason for such mismatch could be a clerical error made by the exporter at the time of filing of GSTR$1 / 6 \mathrm{~A}$, which can be rectified by making amendments in GSTR-1 by using Form 9A. Form 9A has been made available by GSTN w.e.f 15.12.2017 in exporter's login at the GST Common Portal.

# (iii) SB002: EGM not filed 

Exporter may approach the Shipping Lines to file the EGM immediately. If EGM is already filed by shipping Line correctly, "Revalidate EGM" option may be used by EGM Officer.

## (iv) SB003: GSTIN mismatch

This error occurs when GSTIN declared in the SB does not match with the GSTIN used to file the corresponding GST Returns. In this case too, the Exporter may be asked to make necessary adjustments in GSTR-1 by use of amendment Form 9A. If, however, the exporter has declared PAN instead of GSTIN in the Shipping Bill, the option to sanction the refund through officer interface shall be available, provided that the PAN given in the SB matches with the PAN of the GSTIN used to file the returns. Even in cases where the exporter has used one GSTIN to file the returns and another GSTIN issued on the same PAN to file the SB, officer interface can be used to sanction the refund. Detailed procedure is given in Annexure D.

## (v) SB004: Record already received

This error code occurs due to duplicate/repeat transmission of SB-Invoice record from GSTN. The previous transmission would have already been validated with SB000 by ICES. Since these invoices are already validated, this response code may not be treated as an error. The scroll status of such SBs can be checked. If, however, the corresponding SBs are not getting scrolled out despite having SB004 response code, the reasons could be any of those listed above for SB000 cases.

## (vi) SB005: Invalid Invoice Number

This is the most common error faced by the exporters, which occurs due to mismatch of invoice number as declared in the Invoice Table in the SB and that declared in the GSTR 1 for the same supply. This can happen due to:
a) Typographical mistake while entering data in GSTR 1 or the SB.
b) The exporter uses two sets of invoices, one invoice for GST and another invoice for exports resulting in mismatch of invoice numbers.

After the implementation of GST, it was explained that the details an exporter is required to enter in the "invoice" column while filing the SB pertains to the invoice issued by him compliant to GST Invoice Rules. The invoice number shall be matched with GSTN to validate exports and IGST payment. It was understood that there would not be any difference between Commercial Invoice and GST Invoice after GST since as per the GST Laws, the IGST is to be paid on the actual transaction value of the supply between the exporter and the consignee, which should be the same as the one declared on the commercial invoice. However, cases have been noticed on the continuing use of separate commercial invoice leading to mismatch. If SB005 is due to a data entry mistake in GSTR 1, it can be amended now in Form 9A. But any mistake in the SB cannot be amended once EGM is filed. Also, if the exporter has indeed used a separate invoice in the SB, he cannot include that in his GSTR 1 in lieu of his GST Invoice. Thus SB005 error, largely, cannot be corrected by any amendment either in GSTR 1 or in the Shipping Bill. It is advised that the exporters not repeat this mistake and ensure that the same GST compliant export invoice is declared at both ends.

# (vii) SB006: Gateway EGM not available 

In case of ICDs, if the Gateway EGM is not filed electronically or is stuck in some error, response code SB006 shall appear. The EGM shall have to be filed in ICES at the gateway port. Gateway EGM pendency and error reports can be viewed in New MIS role. The Gateway EGM details can also be checked by the exporters on ICEGATE website. In case of pending Gateway EGMs, Shipping Lines may be approached at gateway ports to file supplementary EGMs. The essential steps to file the gateway EGM successfully are:
a) File Train/Truck Summary immediately after cargo leaves the ICD.
b) Ensure that shipping Line mentions the ICD SB in his EGM filed at gateway port along with the transference copy received from gateway port.
c) Errors may be rectified through an amendment in Service Centre and approved by the proper officer. Some of the common EGM errors and their corrective action have been elaborated in Annexure B.

# (viii) SBV00 - SB already validated 

This response code comes in cases of SBs which had certain mismatch error(s) but was validated and sanctioned through the officer interface utility as detailed in Annexure C and D. Even for those single invoice SBs with invoice mismatch where the refund was sanctioned as per the interim procedure mentioned under para (vi) above, SBV00 shall appear. Since these SBs are already validated, this response code may not be treated as an error. The scroll status of these SBs shall also be "Ready" in the IGST Claimed Status Report.

## Issues connected with the Non Transmission of Returns Data from GSTN

The above error codes can be seen by the field officer in the GSTN Integration Status Report in NewMIS. But this report includes only those SBs on which the IGST validation procedure is run. This view is also available to exporters in their ICEGATE login. As mentioned above, the validation procedure for IGST refund is run only for those SBs where EGM has been filed and for which the GSTN has transmitted the GSTR 1 returns data to Customs.

There are primarily two conditions for GSTN to transmit the data:
a) Both, GSTR1/6A and GSTR3B should have been filed for that supply
b) Invoice details (Invoice no, Invoice date or Port Code) are missing or are incorrect for that supply in GSTR 1
c) The cumulative IGST paid on exports declared in GSTR 3B (table 3.1 b) upto the month should not be less than that declared in GSTR1/6A

In respect of (a) and (b) above, the exporter can file or amend the returns accordingly. In case of (c), if the exporter has paid lesser amount in Table 3.1b of GSTR 3B, he can pay the remaining amount in the next GSTR 3B. Since GSTN compares the cumulative amounts, once the difference is paid and the cumulative of GSTR 3.1b becomes greater or equal to the cumulative of GSTR

1-Table 6A, GSTN would start transmitting the data to ICEGATE. However, in cases where the IGST on exports in GSTR 3B has been paid in the column for domestic interstate supplies (Table 3.1a) instead of Zero Rated Supplies, procedure as detailed in Board's Circular 12/2018 dated 29.05.2018 may be followed. If the exporter finds that even after the correct filing of returns as above, their SBs do not reflect in this report, they may be advised to write to GSTN helpdesk.

# Issues related to Scroll Generation 

The refund of IGST on exports shall be given by generating a scroll of eligible Shipping Bills. The temporary IGST refund scroll shall be generated by the authorized officer in the CLK role in ICES. Consequently, a permanent scroll shall be generated by the authorized officer in the AC_DBK role. Only those SBs for which Temporary Scroll has been generated shall be considered for the final scroll. Once the final scroll is generated, there is no further action required from the sanctioning officer. The scroll will automatically be transmitted to PFMS and there is no further need to send the scroll to the bank separately. If a Shipping Bill is appearing in Temporary IGST refund scroll but not in Permanent IGST scroll, there could be two reasons for this:
a) Account details of the exporter have not been validated by PFMS and these scrolls may appear with the "\#" tag. A report consisting of account details which are not validated by PFMS is available both in New MIS role and COM role in ICES. The exporter may be advised to furnish correct bank account details to the proper officer in order to update the same in ICES through CLK role. List of possible PFMS errors reflected in the report and their solution is enclosed as Annexure A.
b) IEC of the exporter might have been suspended by the customs house for want of arrears and e-BRC etc. The SBs shall be available in the final scroll once the suspension is revoked.

There may be cases where the money does not get credited to the exporter's account despite the SB having scrolled out successfully. Primarily, the two possible scenarios are:
i. The entire scroll gets rejected by PFMS. This happens in cases where the account details available with PFMS at the time of receipt of scroll is different than that in the scroll for one or more IECs. In such cases, the jurisdictional System Manager, after having confirmed that the money was indeed not credited to any of the exporters' accounts from that scroll, can write to ICEGATE helpdesk at once 6 giving the scroll details. The reconciliation and scroll cancellation process may take 2-3 weeks. Once the scroll is cancelled, the SBs shall again be available for the next scroll.
ii. The scroll gets accepted by PFMS but the accounts of some exporters get failed by the respective banks due to inactive or invalid account. In such cases, only the exporters with failed accounts shall not have the credit of the refund. These are referred to by PFMS as "Failed after Success" cases for which ICES Advisory 21/2018 dated 17.05.2018 may be seen for the interim procedure to be followed.

# The Role of the Exporter in Resolution of issues 

(a) The exporter has the option to check the GST validation Status for his SBs in his ICEGATE website login. This report shows the exporter the response/error codes for each of his SBs wherever data has been received from GSTN. The reasons for non-receipt of data from GSTN have already been elaborated above.
(b) The exporter also has the option to view the SB details relevant for IGST validation on the ICEGATE website. The exporter can view this while filing the GST Returns and ensure that the details are entered accurately in the Returns as well so that no mismatch occurs.
(c) In case, the exporter's account is not validated by PFMS, he may approach jurisdictional Customs Commissionerate with correct account

details and get it updated in ICES. iv. If the exporter is not getting the refund due to suspension/alert on his IEC, he may clear his dues or submit e-BRC and have the suspension revoked.

# Other Common EGM errors and their Rectification 

## (a) Errors at Gateway Port - SB002 error Container No. Mismatch (Error Code: C)

If the Container Number mentioned in the Shipping Bill(S/B) differs from the Container Number mentioned in the EGM against that S/B, EGM will be submitted with error flag 'C' and the S/B will move to the EGM Error Queue with this error code.
(i) If the mistake is in the EGM, request for EGM Amendment - Update has to be submitted at the service centre. This EGM Amendment has to be approved by proper officer.
(ii) If the mistake is in the S/B, Container Number has to be amended in the S/B.

## (b) Number of Container Mismatch (Error Code: N)

If the Total Number of Containers mentioned in the S/B differs from the Total Number of Containers mentioned in the EGM against that S/B, EGM will be submitted with error flag ' $N$ ' and the S/B will move to the EGM Error Queue with this error code.
(i) If the mistake is in the EGM, request for EGM Amendment Delete has to be submitted at the service centre for deleting the concerned SB from EGM. This EGM Amendment has to be approved by the proper officer. After deletion, Amendment Add has to be submitted at the service centre for adding SB with correct details. This too shall then be approved by the proper officer.

(ii) If the mistake is in the S/B, post stuffing stage, direct amendment is not possible in the S/B. In those cases, a procedure as detailed separately below has to be followed.

# (c) LEO date greater than Sailing Date (Error Code: L) 

If LEO granted for a S/B is cancelled in the System for amendments, the same would be granted again after carrying out the amendments in the System. If Sailing Report for the vessel (EGM), under which the said S/B is covered, is entered in the System before granting the subsequent LEO, then EGM will be submitted with error flag ' $L$ '

At times, while entering the Sailing Report, the Preventive Officer posted at Harbour Main Gate may enter the sailing date wrongly.

There is no option to rectify this error. In such cases, officers posted in EDC have to be contacted for exercising the option "Forceful Removal of SBs from EGM-ERROR", which will remove the concerned S/B from the EGM Error queue.
(d) Nature of Cargo Mismatch (Error Code: T), Number of Packets Mismatch (Error Code: P)
(i) If the mistake is in the EGM, request for EGM Amendment - Update has to be submitted at the service centre. This EGM Amendment has to be approved by the officers posted in EDC.
(ii) If the mistake is in the S/B, post stuffing stage, direct amendment is not possible in the S/B. In those cases, a procedure as detailed separately below has to be followed.
(e) Procedure for correcting errors in Shipping Bill filed at Gateway Port (for SB002 error):

(i) Annexure has to be submitted at the Service Centre for EGM Amendment Delete for deleting the concerned SB from the EGM. This EGM Amendment has to be approved by proper officer.
(ii) After the approval of deletion, LEO granted for the concerned S/B has to be cancelled.
(iii) After the cancellation of LEO, amendments have to be carried out at the Service Centre, as per the procedure. These SB Amendments have also to be approved.
(iv) After the approval, Goods Registration and LEO has to be granted again in the System.
(v) After granting of LEO, Stuffing Report, if required, has to be entered in the System.
(vi) After LEO and/or Stuffing, Annexure has to be submitted at the Service Centre for EGM Amendment- Add for including that SB in the concerned EGM and have it approved by the proper officer.

NOTE: In some cases, after cancellation of LEO, entering correct details at the time of Re-registration, LEO and/or Stuffing alone will solve the problem.

# (f) EGM related errors at ICD (SB006) - Mismatches between the Truck/Train Summary and Gateway EGM 

## Step 1: Check the Gateway EGM Status in ICES/ICEGATE

A view has been given both in ICES (in View SB) as well as ICEGATE public enquiry giving Gateway EGM details. The filing status and EGM error, if any, can be ascertained here. Gateway EGM error and success reports are also available in New MIS. Following are the main errors noticed in Gateway EGM filing:
M - Gateway Port code given in truck summary different from actual gateway port.
N - No. of Container Mismatch
C - Container No. Mismatch
T - Nature of Cargo Mismatch

# Step 2: Gateway EGM details are Blank: 

2a. If the gateway EGM detail is blank in the SB View, kindly ascertain whether the Gateway EGM has indeed been filed and the Gateway EGM No. in which the particular cargo was exported.
2b. Enquire with the Shipping Line, if the EGM filed has the correct details of SB/AWB as the case may be.
2c. If the EGM is already filed, option "Revalidate EGM" in seaports or "Revalidate AWB" in air cargo may be used. The option is available in the EGM role
2d. If the EGM is not filed/ filed incorrectly, supplementary EGM needs to be filed by Shipping Line and approved by Gateway Port Officer.

## Step 3: The Gateway EGM is in Error:

For errors M and L, ICES Advisory 04/2018 dt. 19.02.2018 may be seen. An option has been made available in the role of AC (Exports) of ICDs to rectify Gateway EGM errors M and L resulting in SB006 mismatch. In case of error M, the officer can fill in the actual gateway port of export, and in case of error L, the officer can give the actual sailing date as the LEO date after doing necessary verifications of actual exports as suggested in the advisory.

For errors N and C, an option has been made available in the Preventive Officer role (PREV_OFF) at the Gateway Port to rectify container details. (ICES Advisory 08/18 dt. 09.03.2018). The preventive officer can amend container details in the Gateway EGM CTR Amendment Option to remove the mismatch after verifying the package and quantity details and satisfying himself that there is no short shipment.

For Error A in Gateway EGM, the option of "Revalidate EGM" may be used.

Once the above corrections are made, the gateway port has been given the option to Revalidate EGM in the EGM role to validate the gateway EGM with the corrected values. Even in cases where the local EGM/truck summary is submitted after the filing of the Gateway EGM for some reason, the option to Revalidate EGM should be used first.

With the above options, solution is available with the customs officer for rectifying all the major EGM errors.

# Alternate Mechanism with Officer Interface for SBs with Invoice Mismatch Error (SB005) 

Board has issued Circular 05/2018 dt. 23.02.2018 in this regard, consequently, the officer interface module has been designed and made available in ICES (ICES Advisory 05/2018 dt. 26.02.2018).

The advisory lists the steps to be followed while using the officer interface.
(i) It may be noted that this utility is available only for those SBs where:
a) The error is SB005 only. The SB wise error can be seen from the IGST Integration Status Report in New MIS. Since this report is at invoice level, it may be verified that there is no error other than SB005 for any of the SBs. Only those SBs where there SB005 error exists for at least one invoice and the remaining invoices are validated with SB000 shall be available for rectification in this module. On entering any ineligible SB number, the system shall not allow further processing.
b) If all the invoices of that SB are already validated with SB000, that SB shall not be available for any modification in this utility. Similarly, those single invoice SBs filed before 31.10.2017 where the SB level validation was run despite the SB005 error shall also be not available in this module. For each of these invoices, the system will throw up an error stating that there is no invoice for this SB pending validation.

c) The SBs whose data have not been transmitted by GSTN will also not appear in this module. These SBs shall not be available in the IGST Integration Report either. For such SBs, system will throw up an error that "There is no information received from GSTN for this SB". The exporter may be advised to correct the inconsistencies in GST Returns as detailed in Para 5 first before submitting the concordance table.
(ii) As discussed in the advisory, after entering the eligible SB number, the first screen shown on the system shall be the details as declared by the exporter in his GSTR 1 and as transmitted by GSTN. The next screen shall show the officer the details available in the SB. Here, the officer can accept/change the IGST refund amount basing on the concordance table as also discussed elaborately in the Illustration given in the advisory. The officer shall have to verify each invoice and enter the IGST Refund amount for the system to allow to continue to the next screen. The option to rectify the approved IGST amount has been given to the officer for him to correct any mistakes made by the exporter in declaring the same in SB. The officer can also change the amount if the exporter had inadvertently entered zero value in the SB although he has declared and paid the IGST in the GST Returns for that SB. While the officer shall do the verification basing on the concordance table submitted by the exporter, he can calculate the IGST amount against each invoice himself (ref ICES Advisory 011/2017 dt. 26.07.2017) in case he finds the concordance table to be inaccurate.
(iii) Once the verified IGST amount is entered for all the invoices, the officer can move to the next screen and confirm the invoice mapping as per the concordance table. Once completed, the system shall calculate the IGST scroll amount for that SB. It may be noted here that notwithstanding the amount entered by the officer, the IGST Scroll amount shall be reduced appropriately for the invoices where composite rate of drawback has been claimed for some items. In case, all the items in an invoice are composite drawback rate availed, the IGST scroll amount shall consequently be calculated as zero.
(iv) The verified SBs shall be available for the next scroll even if the error code in the IGST Integration status report does not change immediately. As

also discussed above, once all the invoices of a SB are verified, it shall not be available again for any further rectification in this module.

With this module, solution is available with the customs officer for all the pending SB005 SBs.

Alternate Mechanism with Officer Interface for SBs with Certain Other Errors

In consonance with Para 2(ii) of Board's Circular 08/2018 dt. 23.03.2018 and subsequent instructions from Board, the officer interface facility has been extended to sanction refund in the following two cases, in addition to invoice mismatch cases:
a) Cases where the exporter has erroneously declared that the shipment is without payment of IGST, although they have declared and paid the IGST in GST Returns.
b) SBs with error code SB003, where the exporter has either declared a different GSTIN in the SB or has only declared PAN, and the corresponding returns have been filed through another GSTIN with the same PAN
2. Such cases may now be handled through officer interface the same way as the Invoice Mismatch (SB005) cases, the procedure of which is detailed in Annexure C. In case of (a) above The officer may verify the actual IGST payment in GST Returns for each invoice which is displayed to the officer in the officer interface and basing that, may enter the admissible IGST refund amount in the next screen where data as declared in Shipping Bill is displayed. It is re-iterated that only those SBs where no other mismatch exists shall be available for rectification.
3. In case of (b), an undertaking may be obtained from the GST registered unit which has filed the returns that they have no objection to the refund being granted to the exporter who has filed the Shipping Bill and that they will not claim any IGST Refund for exports under that SB separately. Once satisfied, the Officer may sanction the applicable IGST Refund through the Officer interface.

# Restrictions on the claim of refund of IGST paid on export of goods and services 

In certain situations, the Exporters having already availed of specified benefits may not be eligible to claim a refund of the IGST relating to exports - these are dealt with in Sub-rule (10) of rule 96 of the CGST Rules.

As such, the refund of IGST paid on exported goods and services is not allowed if the goods are procured from a supplier who has availed the benefit of the following notifications: -
(i) Notification no. 40/2017-Central Tax (Rate) or Notification No 41/2017-Integrated Tax (Rate) both dated 23rd October 2017: - This notification prescribes a CGST rate of $0.05 \%$ / IGST $0.1 \%$ if goods are supplied by a registered supplier to a registered recipient for export (merchant exporter) subject to certain conditions.
(ii) Notification no. 48/2017-Central Tax dated 18th October 2017:- This notification notifies supplies to be considered as deemed exports.

However, exporters who have used the EPCG scheme to bring in Capital Goods, either through import in terms of notification No. 79/2017-Customs dated 13.10. 2017 or through domestic procurement in terms of notification No. 48/2017-Central Tax, dated 18.10.2017, continue to be eligible to claim a refund of Integrated tax paid on exports and would not be hit by the restrictions provided in sub-rule (10) of rule 96 of the CGST Rules.

Further, the refund of IGST paid on exported goods and services is also not allowed if the exporter has availed the benefit of the following Notifications:
a) Notification no. 78/2017-Customs dated 13th October 2017:- This notification provides an exemption to IGST and compensation cess levied on goods imported by EOU.
b) Notification no. 79/2017-Customs dated 13th October 2017:- This notification provides IGST exemption and Compensation Cess exemption to goods imported against advance authorization.

The exporter of goods and services in such cases can still export the goods and services only under LUT/ bond but cannot make such export on payment of the integrated tax (IGST).

The explanation to Rule 96(10) clarifies that, the benefit of the notifications mentioned above shall not be considered to have been availed only where the registered person has paid Integrated Goods and Services Tax and Compensation Cess on inputs and has availed exemption of only Basic Customs Duty (BCD) under the said notifications. This makes it clear that the exporter can import goods by availing the Basic Customs Duty exemption under the above notifications but on payment of IGST. In such a case, the provisions of Rule 96(10) will not be attracted, and the exporter can export on payment of IGST.

In any other case, the exporter of goods and services can export the goods and services only under LUT/ bond and cannot export on payment of the integrated tax (IGST).

The tabulation below explains the restrictions made under Rule 96(10) of the CGST Rules, 2017:

The persons claiming refund of integrated tax paid on exports of goods or services should not have received supplies on which the following benefits have been availed: -

1. Notification No. 48/2017Central Tax, dated the 18th October, 2017, except so far it relates to receipt of capital goods by such person against Export Promotion Capital Goods Scheme

# The procedure for claiming a refund on the GST Portal 

A refund application in FORM GST RFD-01 is to be filed on the common portal by an applicant seeking refund under any of the following categories:
(m) Refund of unutilized input tax credit (ITC) on account of exports without payment of tax.
(n) Refund of tax paid on export of services with payment of tax.
(o) Refund of unutilized ITC on account of supplies made to SEZ Unit/SEZ Developer without payment of tax.

![img-12.jpeg](img-12.jpeg.png)

Refund claims under categories listed at (a), (c) and (e) above must be filed by the applicant chronologically. This means that an applicant, after submitting a refund application under any of these categories for a certain period, shall not be subsequently allowed to file a refund claim under the same category for any previous period. This principle/ limitation, however, shall not apply in cases where a fresh application is being filed in a situation where a deficiency memo had been issued earlier.

![img-13.jpeg](img-13.jpeg.png)

The statements/declarations/undertakings which are part of FORM GST RFD-01 itself, and also other documents/invoices which are to be uploaded as
IMPORTANT indicated in Table 3 above are required to be provided by the applicant for processing of the refund claim. No other document needs to be provided by the applicant at the stage of filing of the refund application.
![img-14.jpeg](img-14.jpeg.png)

The applicant, at his option, may file a refund claim for a tax period or by clubbing successive tax periods. Sub-section (3) of section 16 of the Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017and sub-section (3) of section 54 of the CGST Act, there appears no bar in claiming refund by clubbing different months across successive Financial Years (Paragraph 2 of Circular No.135/05/2020-GST, dated $31^{\text {st }}$ March 2020 refers)

Registered persons who are filing quarterly returns for having aggregate turnover less than 1.5 Crore and opting to file FORM GSTR-1 every quarter, can file for Refunds of inverted duty structure for a tax period on a quarterly basis.

# FJAG 

1. Can I file nil refund for multiple tax period in one refund application?

Yes, you can file for nil refund for multiple tax periods in one refund application.
2. Can the nil period of refund be combined with the period in which there is a refund in one application?

Yes, the nil period of refund can be combined with the period in which there is a refund in one application. Let us suppose you want to file a tax refund from

Apr-Sep month, and you also want to file a nil refund for May-Jun month. There are two ways in which you can file your refund application.
a. You can select the Tax Period as Apr-Apr and file a normal refund application. You can then select May-Jun and file a Nil refund application. And, select Jul-Sep and file a normal refund application.
b. You can select the Tax Period as Apr-Sep and file a normal refund application.
![img-15.jpeg](img-15.jpeg.png)

The Application Reference Number (ARN) will be generated only after the applicant has completed the process of filing the refund application in FORM GST RFD-01, and has completed the uploading of all the supporting documents/ undertaking/ statements/invoices and, where required, the amount has been debited from the electronic credit/cash ledger.
![img-16.jpeg](img-16.jpeg.png)

Any refund claim for a tax period may be filed only after furnishing all the returns in FORM GSTR-1 and FORM GSTR-3B which were due to be furnished on or before the date on which the refund application is being filed.

In case of a claim for refund filed by a composition taxpayer, a non-resident taxable person, or an Input Service Distributor (ISD) the applicant should have furnished returns in FORM GSTR-4(along with FORM GST CMP-08), FORM GSTR-5 or FORM GSTR-6, as the case may be, which were due to be furnished on or before the date on which the refund application is being filed.

# Processing of Refund applications in FORM GST RFD-01A wrongly mapped on common portal when submitted by taxpayers 

C.B.I. \& C. Circular No. 104/23/2019-GST, dated 28-6-2019
F. No. CBEC-20/16/04/2018-GST

Government of India
Ministry of Finance (Department of Revenue)
Central Board of Indirect Taxes \& Customs, New Delhi

Subject: Processing of refund applications in FORM GST RFD-01A submitted by taxpayers wrongly mapped on the common portal - Regarding.

Doubts have been raised in respect of processing of a refund application by a jurisdictional tax authority (either Centre or State) to whom the application has been electronically transferred by the common portal in cases where the said tax authority is not the one to which the taxpayer has been administratively assigned. The matter has been examined. In order to ensure uniformity in the implementation of the provisions of the law across field formations, the Board, in exercise of its powers conferred by section 168(1) of the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 (hereinafter referred to as "CGST Act"), hereby clarifies the issues in succeeding paras.
2. It has been reported by the field formations that administrative assignment of some of the taxpayers to the Central or the State tax authority has not been updated on the common portal in accordance with the decision taken by the respective tax authorities, in pursuance of the guidelines issued by the GST Council Secretariat, vide Circular No. 1/2017, dated 20-9-2017

[2017 (7) G.S.T.L. C21], regarding division of taxpayer base between the Centre and States to ensure Single Interface under GST. For example, a taxpayer M/s. XYZ Ltd. was administratively assigned to the Central tax authority but was mapped to the State tax authority on the common portal.
3. Prior to 31-12-2018, refund applications were being processed only after submission of printed copies of FORM GST RFD-01A in the respective jurisdictional tax offices. Subsequent to the issuance of Circular No. 79/53/2018-GST, dated 31-12-2018 [2019 (20) G.S.T.L. C33], copies of refund applications are no longer required to be submitted physically in the jurisdictional tax office. Now, the common portal forwards the refund applications submitted on the said portal to the jurisdictional proper officer of the tax authority to whom the taxpayer has been administratively assigned. In case of the example cited in para 2 above, as the applicant was wrongly mapped with the State tax authority on the common portal, the application was transferred by the common portal to the proper officer of the State tax authority despite M/s. XYZ Ltd. being administratively assigned to the Central tax authority. As per para 2(e) of Circular No. 79/53/2018-GST, dated 31-122018, the proper officer of the State tax authority should electronically reassign the said application to the designated jurisdictional proper officer. It has, however, been reported that the said re-assignment facility is not yet available on the common portal.
4. Doubts have been raised as to whether, in such cases, application for refund can at all be processed by the proper officer of the State tax authority or the Central tax authority to whom the refund application has been wrongly transferred by the common portal.
5. The matter has been examined and it is clarified that in such cases, where reassignment of refund applications to the correct jurisdictional tax authority is not possible on the common portal, the processing of the refund claim should not be held up and it should be processed by the tax authority to whom the refund application has been electronically transferred by the common portal. After the processing of the refund application is complete, the refund processing authority may inform the common portal about the incorrect

mapping with a request to update it suitably on the common portal so that all subsequent refund applications are transferred to the correct jurisdictional tax authority.
6. It is requested that suitable trade notices may be issued to publicize the contents of this Circular.
7. Difficulty, if any, in implementation of this Circular may please be brought to the notice of the Board. Hindi version would follow.

# Export promotion - Goods sent/taken out of India for Exhibition or on Consignment basis for export promotion - Clarification 

C.B.I. \& C. Circular No. 108/27/2019-GST, dated 18-7-2019

F. No. CBEC-20/06/03/2019-GST<br>Government of India<br>Ministry of Finance (Department of Revenue)<br>Central Board of Indirect Taxes \& Customs, New Delhi

Subject: Clarification in respect of goods sent/taken out of India for exhibition or on consignment basis for export promotion - Regarding.

Various representations have been received from the trade and industry regarding procedure to be followed in respect of goods sent/taken out of India for exhibition or on consignment basis for export promotion. Such goods sent/taken out of India crystallise into exports, wholly or partly, only after a gap of certain period from the date they were physically sent/taken out of India.
2. The matter has been examined and in view of the difficulties being faced by the trade and industry and to ensure uniformity in the implementation of the provisions of the law across the field formations, the Board, in exercise of its powers conferred under section 168(1) of the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 (hereinafter referred to as the "CGST Act") hereby clarifies various issues in succeeding paragraphs.
3. As per section 7 of the CGST Act, for any activity or transaction to be considered a supply, it must satisfy twin tests namely -
(i) it should be for a consideration by a person; and
(ii) it should be in the course or furtherance of business.

4. The exceptions to the above are the activities enumerated in Schedule I of the CGST Act which are treated as supply even if made without consideration. Further, sub-section (21) of section 2 of the Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 (hereinafter referred to as the "IGST Act") defines "supply", wherein it is clearly stated that it shall have the same meaning as assigned to it in section 7 of the CGST Act.
5. Section 16 of the IGST Act deals with "Zero rated supply". The provisions contained in the said section read as under :
6. (1) "zero rated supply" means any of the following supplies of goods or services or both, namely :-
(a) export of goods or services or both; or
(b) supply of goods or services or both to a Special Economic Zone developer or a Special Economic Zone unit.

Therefore, it can be concluded that only such 'supplies' which are either 'export' or are 'supply to SEZ unit/developer' would qualify as zero-rated supply.
6. It is, accordingly, clarified that the activity of sending/taking the goods out of India for exhibition or on consignment basis for export promotion, except when such activity satisfy the tests laid down in Schedule I of the CGST Act (hereinafter referred to as the "specified goods"), do not constitute supply as the said activity does not fall within the scope of section 7 of the CGST Act as there is no consideration at that point in time. Since such activity is not a supply, the same cannot be considered as 'Zero rated supply' as per the provisions contained in section 16 of the IGST Act.
7. Since the activity of sending/taking specified goods out of India is not a supply, doubts have been raised by the trade and industry on issues relating to maintenance of records, issuance of delivery challan/tax invoice etc. These issues have been examined and the clarification on each of these points is as under:-

| Sl. <br> No. | Issue | Clarification |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| 1. | Whether any records are required to be maintained by registered person for sending/taking specified goods out of India? | The registered person dealing in specified goods shall maintain a record of such goods as per the format at Annexure to this Circular. |
| 2. | What is the documentation required for sending/taking the specified goods out of India? | (a) As clarified above, the activity of sending/taking specified goods out of India is not a supply. <br> (b) The said activity is in the nature of "sale on approval basis" wherein the goods are sent/taken outside India for the approval of the person located abroad and it is only when the said goods are approved that the actual supply from the exporter located in India to the importer located abroad takes place. The activity of sending/ taking specified goods is covered under the provisions of sub-section (7) of section 31 of the CGST Act read with rule 55 of Central Goods \& Services Tax Rules, 2017 (hereinafter referred to as the "CGST Rules"). <br> (c) The specified goods shall be accompanied with a delivery challan issued in accordance with the provisions contained in rule 55 of the CGST Rules. <br> (d) As clarified in paragraph 6 above, the activity of sending/taking specified goods out of India is not a zero-rated |

|  |  | supply. That being the case, execution of a bond or LUT, as required under section 16 of the IGST Act, is not required. |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| 3. | When is the supply of specified goods sent/taken out of India said to take place? | (a) The specified goods sent/taken out of India are required to be either sold or brought back within the stipulated period of six months from the date of removal as per the provisions contained in subsection (7) of section 31 of the CGST Act. |
|  |  | (b) The supply would be deemed to have taken place, on the expiry of six months from the date of removal, if the specified goods are neither sold abroad nor brought back within the said period. <br> (c) If the specified goods are sold abroad, fully or partially, within the specified period of six months, the supply is effected, in respect of quantity so sold, on the date of such sale. |
| 4. | Whether invoice is required to be issued when the specified goods sent/taken out of India are not brought back, either fully or partially, within the stipulated period? | (a) When the specified goods sent/taken out of India have been sold fully or partially, within the stipulated period of six months, as laid down in subsection (7) of section 31 of the CGST Act, the sender shall issue a tax invoice in respect of such quantity of specified goods which has been sold abroad, in accordance with the provisions contained in section 12 and section 31 of the CGST Act read with rule 46 of the CGST Rules. <br> (b) When the specified goods |

sent/taken out of India have neither been sold nor brought back, either fully or partially, within the stipulated period of six months, as laid down in sub-section (7) of section 31 of the CGST Act, the sender shall issue a tax invoice on the date of expiry of six months from the date of removal, in respect of such quantity of specified goods which have neither been sold nor brought back, in accordance with the provisions contained in section 12 and section 31 of the CGST Act read with rule 46 of the CGST Rules.
5. Whether the refund claims can be preferred in respect of specified goods sent/taken out of India but not brought back?
(a) As clarified in para 5 above, the activity of sending/taking specified goods out of India is not a zero-rated supply. That being the case, the sender of goods cannot prefer any refund claim when the specified goods are sent/taken out of India.
(b) It has further been clarified in answer to question no. 3 above that the supply would be deemed to have taken place:
(i) on the date of expiry of six months from the date of removal, if the specified goods are neither sold nor brought back within the said period; or
(ii) on the date of sale, in respect of such quantity of specified goods which have been sold abroad within the specified period of six months.

![img-17.jpeg](img-17.jpeg.png)
8. The above position is explained by way of illustrations below :

# Illustrations: 

(i) M/s. ABC sends 100 units of specified goods out of India. The activity of merely sending/taking such specified goods out of India is not a supply. No tax invoice is required to be issued in this case but the specified goods shall be accompanied with a delivery challan issued in accordance with the provisions contained in rule 55 of the CGST Rules. In case the entire quantity of specified goods is brought back within the stipulated period of six months from the date of removal, no tax invoice is required to be issued as no supply has taken place in such a case. In case, however, the entire quantity of specified goods is neither sold nor brought back within six months from the date of removal, a tax invoice would be required to be issued for entire 100 units of specified goods in accordance with the provisions contained in section 12 and section

31 of the CGST Act read with rule 46 of the CGST Rules within the time period stipulated under sub-section (7) of section 31 of the CGST Act.
(ii) M/s. ABC sends 100 units of specified goods out of India. The activity of sending/taking such specified goods out of India is not a supply. No tax invoice is required to be issued in this case but the specified goods shall be accompanied with a delivery challan issued in accordance with the provisions contained in rule 55 of the CGST Rules. If 10 units of specified goods are sold abroad say after one month of sending/taking out and another 50 units are sold say after two months of sending/taking out, a tax invoice would be required to be issued for 10 units and 50 units, as the case may be, at the time of each of such sale in accordance with the provisions contained in section 12 and section 31 of the CGST Act read with rule 46 of the CGST Rules.

# The time limit for processing refund claims 

The time limit for sanction of a refund is sixty days from the date of receipt of application which is complete in all respects. (Section 54(7) of the CGST Act, 2017 refers)

## Interest on delayed refunds

In terms of Section 56 of the CGST Act, if any tax ordered to be refunded is not refunded within 60 days of the date of receipt of the application, interest at the rate of 6 percent (notified vide notification No. 13/2017-Central Tax dated 28.06.2017) on the refund amount starting from the date immediately after the expiry of sixty days from the date of receipt of application (ARN) till the date of refund of such tax shall have to be paid to the applicant.

On the point of interest on delayed refunds, any tax shall be considered to have been refunded only when the amount has been credited to the bank account of the applicant. Therefore, interest will be calculated starting from the date immediately after the expiry of sixty days from the date of receipt of the application till the date on which the amount is credited to the bank account of the applicant.

Where any claim of refund arises from an order passed by an adjudicating authority or Appellate Authority or Appellate Tribunal or court which has attained finality and the same is not refunded within sixty days from the date of receipt of an application filed consequent to such order, interest at such rate not exceeding $9 \%$ shall be payable in respect of such refund from the date immediately after the expiry of sixty days from the date of receipt of application till the date of refund.

Where any order of refund is made by an Appellate Authority, Appellate Tribunal or any court against an order of the proper officer in Form GST RFD 06 passed under Section 54(5), the order passed by the Appellate Authority, Appellate Tribunal or

by the court shall be deemed to be an order passed under the said Section 54(5)

# Deficiency Memo 

Where deficiencies are noticed in the application for the refund, a deficiency memo in Form GST RFD-03 will be issued within 15 days starting from the date of generation of ARN (Refer Rule 90(3) of the CGST Rules)

Once an acknowledgment has been issued in relation to a refund application, no deficiency memo, on any grounds, maybe subsequently issued for the said application.

After a deficiency memo has been issued, the refund application would not be further processed and a fresh application would have to be filed.

The applicant is required to rectify the deficiencies highlighted in deficiency memo and file fresh refund application electronically in FORM GST RFD-01 again for the same period and this application would have a new and distinct ARN.

Any amount of input tax credit/cash debited from electronic credit/ cash ledger would be re-credited automatically once the deficiency memo has been issued.

Once an application has been submitted afresh, pursuant to a deficiency memo, the proper officer will not serve another deficiency memo with respect to the application for the same period, unless the deficiencies pointed out in the original deficiency memo remain un-rectified, either wholly or partly, or any other substantive deficiency is noticed subsequently.

# Grant of Provisional refund 

To ameliorate any short-term hardships to the exporters, the refunds are released on a provisional basis to the extent of $90 \%$ even before complete scrutiny of application and related records. Provisional refund is granted in terms of Section 54 (6) of the CGST Act.

Provisional refund is applicable only in respect of refund claims on account of zero-rate supply of goods and services made by registered persons.

Zero-rated supplies include:
(a) Export of Goods or Services
(b) Supplies made to Special Economic Zone (SEZ) units and Developers

The proper officer, after scrutiny of the refund claim and the evidence submitted and on being satisfied that the amount claimed as a refund on zerorated supplies is due to the applicant, is to make an order in FORM GST RFD04, sanctioning the amount of refund due to the said applicant on a provisional basis within a period of seven days from the date of the acknowledgment issued in Form GST RFD-02.

The proper officer issues a payment order in FORM GST RFD-05 for the amount sanctioned as provisional refund and the same is electronically credited to any of the bank accounts of the applicant mentioned in his registration particulars and as specified in the application for a refund based on the consolidated payment advice.

Where the refund has not been disbursed within the same financial year in which the said payment order was issued, the FORM GST RFD-05 shall be required to be revalidated. However, the order issued in FORM GST RFD-04 shall not be required to be revalidated by the proper officer.

No adjustment or withholding of refund is permitted in respect of the amount of refund which has been provisionally sanctioned. In cases where there is an outstanding recoverable amount due from the applicant, the proper officer,

instead of granting a refund on a provisional basis, may process and sanction refund on the final basis at the earliest and recover the amount from the amount so sanctioned.
![img-19.jpeg](img-19.jpeg.png)

Q-1: Whether a provisional refund would be given even in those cases where the proper officer prima-facie has sufficient reasons to believe that there are irregularities in the refund application which would result in rejection of whole or part of the refund amount so claimed?

Reply: Where the proper officer prima-facie has sufficient reasons to believe that there are irregularities in the refund application which would result in rejection of whole or part of the refund amount so claimed, then in such cases, the proper officer shall refund on a provisional basis ninety percent of the refundable amount of the claim (amount of refund claim less the inadmissible portion of the refund.

Q-2: Is there a prohibition under the law preventing a proper officer from sanctioning the entire amount within 7 days of the issuance of acknowledgment through the issuance of FORM GST RFD-06, instead of a grant of provisional refund of 90 percent of the amount claimed through FORM GST RFD-04?

Reply: If the proper officer is fully satisfied with the eligibility of a refund claim on account of zero-rated supplies, and believes that no further scrutiny is required, the proper officer may issue a final order in FORM GST RFD-06 within 7 days of the issuance of acknowledgment. In such cases, the issuance of a provisional refund order in FORM GST RFD-04 will not be necessary.

Q-3: What is the procedure to be followed in situations where the final refund amount to be sanctioned in FORM GST RFD-06 is less than the amount of refund sanctioned provisionally through FORM GST RFD-04?

Reply: In such cases, the proper officer shall have to issue a show-cause notice to the applicant, in FORM GST RFD-08, under section 54 of the CGST Act, read with section 73 or 74 of the CGST Act. For example, where an applicant files a refund claim of Rs.100/- on account of zero-rated supplies.

The proper officer, after prima-facie examination of the application, sanctions Rs. 90 as a provisional refund through FORM GST RFD-04 and the same is electronically credited to his bank account. However, on detailed examination, it appears to the proper officer that only an amount of Rs. 70 is admissible as a refund to the applicant, then an SCN is required to be issued requiring the applicant to show cause as to why:
\& The amount claimed of Rs. 30/- should not be rejected as per the relevant provisions of the law; and
\& The amount of Rs. 20/- erroneously refunded should not be recovered under section 73 or section 74 of the CGST Act, as the case may be, along with interest and penalty, if any.

Q-4: Who is the proper officer for adjudicating the SCN in the case above?
Reply: The proper officer for adjudicating the above case shall be the same as the proper officer for sanctioning refund under section 54 of the CGST Act. The above notice shall be adjudicated following the principles of natural justice and an order shall be issued, in FORM GST RFD-06, under section 54 of the CGST Act, read with section 73 or section 74 of the CGST Act, as the case may be.

Q-5: What is the procedure to be followed after an adjudication order is passed against the applicant?

Reply: If the adjudicating authority decides against the applicant in respect of both points (a) and (b) as per the above example, then an amount of Rs. 70/ will have to be sanctioned in FORM GST RFD-06, and an amount of Rs. 20/-, along with interest and penalty, if any, shall be entered by the officer in the electronic liability register of the applicant through the issuance of FORM GST DRC-07.

Further, if the application pertains to a refund of unutilized/accumulated ITC, then Rs. 30/-, i.e. the amount rejected, shall have to be re-credited to the electronic credit ledger of the applicant through FORM GST PMT-03. This recredit shall be done only after the receipt of an undertaking from the applicant

to the effect that he shall not file an appeal or in case he files an appeal, the same has been finally decided against the applicant.

# Refund of unutilized ITC on account of zero-rated supplies made without payment of tax 

Applicants of refunds of unutilized ITC, i.e. refunds pertaining to:
(i) Refund of unutilized input tax credit (ITC) on account of exports without payment of tax;
(ii) Refund of unutilized ITC on account of supplies made to SEZ Unit/SEZ Developer without payment of tax

Must upload a copy of FORM GSTR-2A for the relevant period (or any prior or subsequent period(s) in which the relevant invoices have been autopopulated) for which the refund is claimed. The proper officer would rely upon FORM GSTR-2A as an evidence that the concerned suppliers have properly accounted for their corresponding supplies in relation to which the input tax credit has been availed of by the applicant.

Such applicants shall also upload the details of all the invoices on the basis of which input tax credit has been availed during the relevant period for which the refund is being claimed, in the format specified as Annexure-B in Circular No 125/2019 along with the application for refund claim. Such an availment of ITC will be subject to the restriction imposed under sub-rule (4) in rule 36 of the CGST rules inserted vide Notification No. 49/2019-CT dated 09.10.2019. Refund of accumulated ITC shall be restricted to the ITC as per those invoices, the details of which are uploaded by the supplier in Form GSTR-1 and are reflected in the Form GSTR-2A of the applicant.
![img-20.jpeg](img-20.jpeg.png)

Should the refund of accumulated ITC on import documents, ISD invoices and RCM invoices be rejected as they are not reflected in the Form GSTR-2A of the applicant?

Ans: Before the issuance of Circular No. 135/05/2020GST dated 31st March, 2020, refund was being granted even in respect of credit availed on the strength of missing invoices (not reflected in FORM GSTR-2A) which were uploaded by the applicant along with the refund application on the

common portal. However, vide Circular No.135/05/2020 - GST dated the 31st March, 2020, the refund related to these missing invoices has been restricted. Now, the refund of accumulated ITC shall be restricted to the ITC available on those invoices, the details of which are uploaded by the supplier in FORM GSTR-1 and are reflected in the FORM GSTR-2A of the applicant. The treatment of refund of such ITC relating to imports, ISD invoices and the inward supplies liable to Reverse Charge (RCM supplies) will continue to be same as it was before the issuance of Circular No. 135/05/2020GST dated 31st March, 2020.

The applicant shall also declare the eligibility or otherwise of the input tax credit availed against the invoices related to the claim period in the said format for enabling the proper officer to determine the same. Self-certified copies of invoices in relation to which the refund of ITC is being claimed and which are declared as eligible for ITC in Annexure - B, but which are not populated in FORM GSTR-2A, shall be uploaded by the applicant along with the application in FORM GST RFD 01. The proper officer shall not insist on the submission of an invoice (either original or duplicate) the details of which are available in FORM GSTR-2A of the relevant period uploaded by the applicant.

# Steps for filing the application on the GST Portal for a refund of unutilized ITC on account of zero-rated supplies without payment of Tax 

The applicant has to file a refund application in Form RFD-01 at GST Portal.

* The applicant has to provide a turnover of Zero-Related supplies and Adjusted Total Turnover for the period refund is sought for.
* The Net ITC auto-populated can be edited downwards. The Net ITC in the table "Computation of Refund to be claimed" is auto-populated by the system and can be edited downwards considering net ITC availed for the heads of CGST/SGST/IGST together and Cess in the return for the respective tax period for which refund is claimed excluding any ITC related to Capital Goods, transition ITC that may have been posted in the

ledger on account of transition ITC claims in the said period as well as refund claimed under Rule 89(4A) (deemed export) and/ or (4B) (merchant exporter or export).
4 The system will auto calculate the eligible refund amount and post in the last column of the table "Maximum refund amount to be claimed.
4 The system also indicates balances in each head of the taxpayer's Electronic Credit ledger on the day of filing of the return of the tax period and the balance when he is filing the refund application
4 The taxpayer has to enter the amount of refund claimed in such a manner that the amount in each head is equal to or lower than the lowest balance in each head of Electronic credit ledger indicated above and the total refund should not exceed the "Maximum Refund that can be claimed".
4 The applicant has to be careful while furnishing values in Form RFD-01, as no rectification in the application is allowed after its filling.
4 The applicant has to ensure that he has filed the return GSTR-1 and GSTR- 3B for the all the tax periods pertaining to which Refund is claimed.
4 Balance in ITC ledger should be sufficient in each head (IGST/CGST/SGST/UTGST/CESS).
4 He should have exported goods/services on account of which he is claiming an ITC refund. In the case of Export of Goods, the taxpayer shall provide Shipping Bill and EGM details.
4 In case of export of services, he should have obtained FIRC/BRC from the concerned bank for receipt of foreign exchange.
4 Once Application Reference Number (ARN) is generated, the refund application filed shall be assigned to Jurisdictional Refund Processing Officer for processing. A refund applicant can track the status of the refund application filed using the "Track Application status" functionality on the portal.

Note: Form RFD 01 for a period can be filed only after filing of valid Form GSTR-1 and Form GSTR-3B for that particular Return Period.

The Invoice details as given under Form GSTR - 1/ Table 6A of Form GSTR- 1 and that given under refund statement should be the same.

# Scrutiny of Refund application in respect of zero-rated supplies without payment of tax 

In case of refund claim on account of export of goods without payment of tax, the Shipping bill details shall be checked by the proper officer through ICEGATE SITE (www.icegate.gov.in) wherein the officer would be able to check details of EGM and shipping bill by keying in port name, Shipping bill number, and date. It is advised that while processing refund claims, the information contained in Table 9 of FORM GSTR-1 of the relevant tax period, as well as that of the subsequent tax periods, should also be taken into cognizance, wherever applicable. In this regard, Circular No. 26/26/2017-GST dated 29.12.2017 may be referred, wherein the procedure for rectification of errors made while filing the returns in FORM GSTR-3B has been provided. Therefore, in case of discrepancies between the data furnished by the taxpayer in FORM GSTR-3B and Form GSTR-1, the proper officer shall refer to the said Circular and process the refund application accordingly.

## The formula for a refund of unutilized ITC on exports and supplies to SEZ/Developer without payment of tax - Rule 89(4)

In case of refunds of unutilized ITC on account of zero-rated supplies, the refund is calculated as per the following formula:

Refund Amount $=$ (Turnover of zero-rated supply of goods + Turnover of zerorated supply of services) x Net ITC $\div$ Adjusted Total Turnover

Where, -
(A) "Refund amount" means the maximum refund that is admissible;

(B) "Net ITC" means input tax credit availed on inputs and input services during the relevant period other than the input tax credit availed for which refund is claimed under sub-rules (4A) or (4B) or both;
(C) " Turnover of zero-rated supply of goods" means the value of zero-rated supply of goods made during the relevant period without payment of tax under bond or letter of undertaking or the value which is 1.5 times the value of like goods domestically supplied by the same or, similarly placed, supplier, as declared by the supplier, whichever is less, other than the turnover of supplies in respect of which refund is claimed under sub-rules (4A) or (4B) or both;
(D) "Turnover of zero-rated supply of services" means the value of zero-rated supply of services made without payment of tax under bond or letter of undertaking, calculated in the following manner, namely:-

Zero-rated supply of services is the aggregate of the payments received during the relevant period for zero-rated supply of services and zero-rated supply of services where supply has been completed for which payment had been received in advance in any period before the relevant period reduced by advances received for zero-rated supply of services for which the supply of services has not been completed during the relevant period;
(E) "Adjusted Total Turnover" means the sum total of the value of-
(a) the turnover in a State or a Union territory, as defined under clause (112) of section 2, excluding the turnover of services; and (b) the turnover of zerorated supply of services determined in terms of clause (D) above and non-zero-rated supply of services, excluding- (i) the value of exempt supplies other than zero-rated supplies; and (ii) the turnover of supplies in respect of which refund is claimed under sub-rule (4A) or sub-rule (4B) or both, if any, during the relevant period.
(F) "Relevant period" means the period for which the claim has been filed.

# Calculation of the refundable amount on the GST Portal 

The common portal calculates the refundable amount as the least of the following amounts:
(i) The maximum refund amount as per the formula in rule 89(4) of the CGST Rules [formula is applied on the consolidated amount of ITC, i.e. Central tax + State tax/Union Territory tax +Integrated tax];
(ii) The balance in the electronic credit ledger of the applicant at the end of the tax period for which the refund claim is being filed after the return in FORM GSTR-3B for the said period has been filed; and
(iii) The balance in the electronic credit ledger of the applicant at the time of filing the refund application.

After calculating the least of the three amounts, as detailed above, the equivalent amount is to be debited from the electronic credit ledger of the applicant in the following order:
a) Integrated tax, to the extent of balance available;
b) Central tax and State tax/Union Territory tax, equally to the extent of balance available and in the event of a shortfall in the balance available in a particular electronic credit ledger (say, Central tax), the differential amount is to be debited from the other electronic credit ledger (i.e., State tax/Union Territory tax, in this case).

The order of debit described above, however, is not presently available on the common portal. Till the time such a facility is made available on the common portal, the taxpayers are to follow the order as explained above for all refund applications. However, for applications where this order is not adhered to by the applicant, no adverse view may be taken by the tax authorities.

For all refund applications where a refund of unutilized ITC of compensation cess is being claimed, the calculation of the refundable amount of compensation cess shall be done separately and the amount so calculated will be entirely debited from the balance of compensation cess available in the electronic credit ledger.

The third proviso to sub-section (3) of section 54 of the CGST Act states that no refund of the input tax credit shall be allowed in cases where the supplier of goods or services or both avails of drawback in respect of Central tax. However, if a supplier avails of drawback in respect of duties rebated under the Customs and Central Excise Duties Drawback Rules, 2017, he shall be eligible for a refund of unutilized input tax credit of Central tax/ State tax/ Union Territory tax / Integrated tax/ Compensation cess. It is also clarified that refund of eligible credit on account of State tax shall be available if the supplier of goods or services or both has availed of drawback in respect of Central tax.

No refund of unutilized input tax credit shall be allowed in cases where the goods exported out of India are subjected to export duty.

Recovery of refund of unutilised input tax credit or of integrated tax paid on export of goods where export proceeds not realized

Rule 96B of the CGST Rules (inserted with effect from 23.03.2020 vide Notification No 16/2020 CT dt 23.03.2020) provides that where any refund of unutilised input tax credit on account of export of goods or of integrated tax paid on export of goods has been paid to an applicant but the sale proceeds in respect of such export goods have not been realised, in full or in part, in India within the period allowed under the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (42 of 1999), including any extension of such period, the person to whom the refund has been made shall deposit the amount so refunded, to the extent of non-realisation of sale proceeds, along with applicable interest within thirty days of the expiry of the said period or, as the case may be, the extended period, failing which the amount refunded shall be recovered in accordance with the provisions of section 73 or 74 of the Act, as the case may be, as is

applicable for recovery of erroneous refund, along with interest under section 50 .

However, where sale proceeds, or any part thereof, in respect of such export goods are not realised by the applicant within the period allowed under the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (42 of 1999), but the Reserve Bank of India writes off the requirement of realisation of sale proceeds on merits, the refund paid to the applicant shall not be recovered.

Where the sale proceeds are realised by the applicant, in full or part, after the amount of refund has been recovered from him under sub-rule (1) and the applicant produces evidence about such realisation within a period of three months from the date of realisation of sale proceeds, the amount so recovered shall be refunded by the proper officer, to the applicant to the extent of realisation of sale proceeds, provided the sale proceeds have been realised within such extended period as permitted by the Reserve Bank of India.

An undertaking to the above effect has been inserted in the Form GST RFD-01.

# Letter of Undertaking (LUT) 

Export of goods or services can be made without payment of Integrated tax under the provisions of rule 96A of the CGST Rules. Under the said provisions, an exporter is required to furnish a bond or Letter of Undertaking (LUT) to the jurisdictional Commissioner before effecting zero-rated supplies. Notification No 37/2017 CT dated 04.10.2017 requires a LUT to be furnished for a financial year.

The LUT is filed electronically in Form RFD-11 on the GST Portal A detailed procedure for filing of LUT was specified vide Circular No. 8/8/2017 -GST dated 4.10.2017. In some cases, such zero-rated supplies were made before filing the LUT, and refund claims for unutilized input tax credit got filed. In this regard, it is emphasized that the substantive benefits of zero-rating may not be denied where it has been established that exports in terms of the relevant provisions have been made. The delay in furnishing of LUT in such cases may be condoned and the facility for export under LUT may be allowed on ex post facto basis considering the facts and circumstances of each case.

Rule 96A (1) of the CGST Rules provides that any registered person may export goods or services without payment of Integrated tax after furnishing a LUT / bond and that he would be liable to pay the tax due along with the interest as applicable within a period of fifteen days after the expiry of three months or such further period as may be allowed by the Commissioner from the date of issue of the invoice for export if the goods are not exported out of India. The time period in case of services is - fifteen days after the expiry of one year or such further period as may be allowed by the Commissioner from the date of issue of the invoice for export, if the payment of such services is not received by the exporter in convertible foreign exchange.

It is emphasized that exports have been zero rated under the IGST Act and as long as goods have actually been exported even after a period of three months, payment of Integrated tax first and claiming refund at a subsequent date should not be insisted upon. In such cases, the jurisdictional Commissioner may consider granting extension of time limit for export as

provided in the said sub-rule on post facto basis keeping in view the facts and circumstances of each case. The same principle should be followed in case of export of services.

The facility of export under LUT is available to all exporters in terms of notification No. 37/2017- Central Tax dated 04.10.2017, except to those who have been prosecuted for any offence under the CGST Act or the IGST Act or any of the existing laws in force in a case where the amount of tax evaded exceeds two hundred and fifty lakh rupees. Para 2(d) of the Circular No. 8/8/2017-GST dated 04.10.2017, mentions that a person intending to export under LUT is required to give a self-declaration at the time of submission of LUT that he has not been prosecuted. Persons who are not eligible to export under LUT are required to export under bond. It is clarified that this requirement is already satisfied in case of exports under LUT and asking for self-declaration with every refund claim where the exports have been made under LUT is not warranted.

# Relaxations during COVID-19 

In terms of Notification No 35/2020 CT dated 03.04.2020, where LUTs have expired on 31.03.2020, the time limit for filing the LUT for the year 2020-21 shall stand extended up to 30.06.2020 and the taxpayer can continue to make the supply without payment of tax under LUT provided that the Form RFD-11 for 2020-21 is furnished on or before 30.06.2020. Taxpayers may quote the reference number of the LUT for the year 2019-20 in the relevant documents.

In wake of COVID pandemic, date further extended till 31.08.2020 for certain compliance under GST laws and till 30.09.2020 for certain compliance Customs, Central Excise and Service Tax Laws - https://www.cbic.gov.in/htdocs-cbec/home_links/tickers as of 30.6.2020 at 19:30 hours

# Clarifications on issues related to refund of unutilised ITC on account of zero-rated supplies 

While filing the return in FORM GSTR-3B for a given tax period, certain registered persons committed errors in declaring the export of services on payment of integrated tax or zero-rated supplies made to a Special Economic Zone developer or a Special Economic Zone unit on payment of integrated tax. They have shown such supplies in the Table under column 3.1(a) instead of showing them in column 3.1(b) of FORM GSTR-3B whilst they have shown the correct details in Table 6A or 6B of FORM GSTR-1 for the relevant tax period and duly discharged their tax liabilities. Such registered persons were earlier unable to file the refund application in FORM GST RFD-01A for refund of integrated tax paid on the export of services or on supplies made to a SEZ developer or a SEZ unit on the GST common portal because of an in-built validation check in the system which restricted the refund amount claimed (integrated tax/cess) to the amount of integrated tax/cess mentioned under column 3.1(b) of FORM GSTR3B (zero-rated supplies) filed for the corresponding tax period.

For the tax periods commencing from 01.07.2017 to 30.06.2019, such registered persons shall be allowed to file the refund application in FORM GST RFD-01 on the common portal subject to the condition that the amount of refund of integrated tax/cess claimed shall not be more than the aggregate amount of integrated tax/cess mentioned in the Table under columns 3.1(a), 3.1(b) and 3.1(c) of FORM GSTR-3B filed for the corresponding tax period.

In certain cases, the refund of unutilized input tax credit on account of export of goods is claimed and the value declared in the tax invoice is different from the export value declared in the corresponding shipping bill under the Customs Act. The value recorded in the GST invoice should normally be the transaction value as determined under section 15 of the CGST Act read with the rules made thereunder. The same transaction value should normally be recorded in the corresponding shipping bill/bill of export. During the processing of the refund claim, the value of the goods declared in the GST

invoice and the value in the corresponding shipping bill/bill of export should be examined and the lower of the two values should be taken into account while calculating the eligible amount of refund.

The realization of consideration in convertible foreign exchange, or in Indian rupees wherever permitted by Reserve Bank of India, is one of the conditions for export of services. In case of export of goods, realization of consideration is not a pre-condition. In rule 89 (2) of the CGST Rules, a statement containing the number and date of invoices and the relevant Bank Realization Certificates (BRC) or Foreign Inward Remittance Certificates (FIRC) is required in case of export of services whereas, in case of export of goods, a statement containing the number and date of shipping bills or bills of export and the number and the date of the relevant export invoices is required to be submitted along with the claim for refund. It is therefore clarified that insistence on proof of realization of export proceeds for processing of refund claims related to the export of goods has not been envisaged in the law and should not be insisted upon.

As per section 16(2) of the IGST Act, credit of input tax may be availed for making zero-rated supplies; notwithstanding that such supply is an exempt supply. In terms of section 2 (47) of the CGST Act, exempt supply includes the non-taxable supply. Further, as per section 16(3) of the IGST Act, a registered person making zero rated supply shall be eligible to claim a refund when he either makes a supply of goods or services or both under bond or letter of undertaking (LUT) or makes such supply on payment of Integrated tax. However, in case of a zero-rated supply of exempted or non-GST goods, the requirement for furnishing a bond or LUT cannot be insisted upon. It is thus, clarified that in respect of refund claims on account of export of non-GST and exempted goods without payment of Integrated tax; LUT/bond is not required. Such registered persons exporting non-GST goods shall comply with the requirements prescribed under the existing law (i.e. Central Excise Act, 1944 or the VAT law of the respective State) or under the Customs Act, 1962, if any. Further, the exporter would be eligible for a refund of unutilized input tax credit of Central tax, State tax, Union Territory tax, Integrated tax and compensation cess in such cases.

# Refund of IGST on the export of Service on payment of Tax 

The taxpayer will file the refund application in Form RFD-01 on the GST portal. The taxpayer shall choose ground of refund as "Exports of services with payment of tax" for claiming the refund.

The following conditions must be met, for being eligible to file Form RFD-01, to claim refund on account of Export of Services (with payment of tax):

# Accessing the Export Ledger on the GST Portal 

The GST Portal uses ledger based approach to cumulate the IGST/CESS from export/SEZ invoices (Table 6A/9A/6B of GSTR 1), and compare with IGST/CESS paid under Table 3.1(b) of GSTR 3B across all periods.

The eligible invoices are transmitted by GST Portal to ICEGATE only if the IGST/CESS paid under Table 3.1(b) >= IGST/CESS from invoices of Tables 6A/6B/9A. The difference between IGST/CESS from Table 3.1(b) and Tables 6A/6B/9A is recorded as export ledger balance in the GST Portal. In case of negative balance, GST Portal will not transmit any eligible invoice to ICEGATE.

# Refund of Compensation Cess 

A registered person is eligible to claim refund of unutilized input tax credit of compensation cess paid on inputs, where the zero-rated final product is not leviable to compensation cess. For instance, cess is levied on coal, which is an input for the manufacture of aluminium products, whereas cess is not levied on aluminium products. However, a registered person making zero rated supply of aluminium products under bond or LUT may claim refund of unutilized credit including that of compensation cess paid on coal. Such registered persons may also make zero-rated supply of aluminium products on payment of Integrated tax but they cannot utilize the credit of the compensation cess paid on coal for payment of Integrated tax in view of the proviso to section 11(2) of the Cess Act, which allows the utilization of the input tax credit of cess, only for the payment of cess on the outward supplies.

## FJ A $\odot$

Q-1: A registered person uses inputs on which compensation cess is leviable (e.g. coal) to export goods on which there is no levy of compensation cess (e.g. aluminium). For the period July, 2017 to May, 2018, no ITC is availed of the compensation cess paid on the inputs received during this period. ITC is only availed of the Central tax, State tax/Union Territory tax or Integrated tax charged on the invoices for these inputs. This ITC is utilized for payment of Integrated tax on export of goods. Vide Circular No. 45/19/2018-GST dated 30.05.2018, it was clarified that refund of accumulated ITC of compensation cess on account of zero-rated supplies made under Bond/Letter of Undertaking is available even if the exported product is not subject to levy of cess. After the issuance of this Circular, the registered person decides to start exporting under bond/LUT without payment of tax. He also decides to avail (through the return in FORM GSTR-3B) the ITC of compensation cess, paid on the inputs used in the months of July, 2017 to May, 2018, in the month of July, 2018. The registered person then goes on to file a refund claim for ITC accumulated on account of exports for the month of July, 2018 and includes the said accumulated ITC for

the month of July, 2018. How should the amount of compensation cess to be refunded be calculated?

Reply: In the instant case, refund on account of compensation cess is to be recomputed as if the same was available in the respective months in which the refund of unutilized credit of Central tax/State tax/Union Territory tax/Integrated tax was claimed on account of exports made under LUT/Bond. If the aggregate of these recomputed amounts of refund of compensation cess is less than or equal to the eligible refund of compensation cess calculated in respect of the month in which the same has actually been claimed, then the aggregate of the recomputed refund of compensation cess of the respective months would be admissible. However, the recomputed amount of eligible refund (of compensation cess) in respect of past periods, as aforesaid, would not be admissible in respect of consignments exported on payment of Integrated tax. This process would be applicable for application(s) for a refund of compensation cess (not claimed earlier) in respect of the past period.

Q-2: A registered person uses coal for the captive generation of electricity which is further us ed for the manufacture of goods (say aluminium) which are exported under Bond/Letter of Undertaking without payment of duty. A refund claim is filed for accumulated Input Tax Credit of compensation cess paid on coal. Can the said refund claim be rejected on the ground that coal is used for the generation of electricity which is an intermediate product and not the final product which is exported and since electricity is exempt from GST, the ITC of the tax paid on coal for the generation of electricity is not available?

Reply: There is no distinction between intermediate goods or services and final goods or services under GST. Inputs have been clearly defined to include any goods other than capital goods used or intended to be used by a supplier in the course or furtherance of business. Since coal is an input used in the production of aluminium, albeit indirectly through the captive generation of electricity, which is directly connected with the business of the registered person, input tax credit in relation to the same cannot be denied.

Q-3: A registered person avails ITC of compensation cess (say, of Rs. 100/-) paid on purchases of coal every month. At the same time, he reverses a certain proportion (say, half i.e. Rs. 50/-) of the ITC of compensation cess so availed on purchases of coal which are used in making zero rated outward supplies. Both these details are entered in the FORM GSTR-3B filed for the month as a result of which an amount of Rs. 50/- only is credited in the electronic credit ledger. The reversed amount (Rs. 50/-) is then shown as a 'cost' in the books of accounts of the registered person. However, the registered person declares Rs. 100/- as 'Net ITC' and uses the same in calculating the maximum refund amount which works out to be Rs. 50/- (assuming that export turnover is half of total turnover). Since both the balance in the electronic credit ledger at the end of the tax period for which the claim of refund is being filed and the balance in the electronic credit ledger at the time of filing the refund claim is Rs. 50/- (assuming that no other debits/credits have happened), the common portal will proceed to debit Rs. 50/from the ledger as the claimed refund amount. The question is whether the proper officer should sanction Rs. 50/- as the refund amount or Rs. 25/- (i.e. half of the ITC availed after adjusting for reversals)?

Reply: ITC which is reversed cannot be held to have been 'availed' in the relevant period. Therefore, the same cannot be part of refund of unutilized ITC on account of zero-rated supplies. Moreover, the reversed ITC has been accounted as a cost which would have reduced the income tax liability of the applicant. Therefore, the same amount cannot, at the same time, be refunded to him/her in the ratio of export turnover to total turnover. However, if the said reversed amount is again availed in a later tax period, subject to the restriction under section 16(4) of the CGST Act, it can be refunded in the ratio of export turnover to total turnover in that tax period in the same manner as detailed in the section on refunds of unutilized ITC above. This is subject to the restriction that the accounting entry showing the said ITC as cost is also reversed.

# Refund of transitional credit 

Refund of unutilized input tax credit is allowed in two scenarios mentioned in sub-section (3) of section 54 of the CGST Act. These two scenarios are zero rated supplies made without payment of tax and inverted tax structure. In sub-rule (4) and (5) of rule 89 of the CGST Rules, the amount of refund under these scenarios is to be calculated using the formulae given in the said subrules. The formulae use the phrase 'Net ITC' and defines the same as "input tax credit availed on inputs and input services during the relevant period other than the input tax credit availed for which refund is claimed under sub-rules (4A) or (4B) or both". It is clarified that as the transitional credit pertains to duties and taxes paid under the existing laws viz., under Central Excise Act, 1944 and Chapter V of the Finance Act, 1994, the same cannot be said to have been availed during the relevant period and thus, cannot be treated as part of 'Net ITC' and thus no refund of such unutilized transitional credit is admissible.

# Refund of accumulated ITC on account of inverted tax structure 

Sub-section (3) of section 54 of the CGST Act provides that refund of any unutilized ITC may be claimed where the credit has accumulated on account of rate of tax on inputs being higher than the rate of tax on output supplies (other than nil rated or fully exempt supplies). Further, subsection (59) of section 2 of the CGST Act defines inputs as any goods other than capital goods used or intended to be used by a supplier in the course or furtherance of business. Thus, on a conjoint reading of the above provisions of the Act, it is clear that refund of unutilised input tax credit due to inverted duty structure is allowed only where such accumulation takes place on account of rate of tax on inputs (excluding input services or capital goods) being higher than the rate of tax on output supplies. Therefore, clearly, the intent of the law is not to allow refund of tax paid on input services or capital goods as part of refund of unutilized input tax credit.

# Formula for refund of unutilized ITC on account of inverted duty structure - Rule 89(5) 

Rule 89(5) prescribes a formula to calculate "maximum refund amount" in cases of refund on account of inverted duty structure. The said Rule 89(5) was amended vide Notification No 21/2018 CT dated 18.04.2018 so as to align the rule with the Act by specifically excluding input services from the definition of Net ITC.

In case of refund of unutilized ITC on account of inverted duty structure, the refund is calculated as per the following formula:

Maximum Refund Amount $=\{$ (Turnover of inverted rated supply of goods and services $\} x$ Net ITC $\div$ Adjusted Total Turnover $\}$ - tax payable on such inverted rated supply of goods and services.

Explanation: - For the purposes of this sub-rule, the expressions -
(a) "Net ITC" shall mean input tax credit availed on inputs during the relevant period other than the input tax credit availed for which refund is claimed under sub-rules (4A) or (4B) or both; and
(b) "Adjusted Total Turnover" means the sum total of the value of-
(a) the turnover in a State or a Union territory, as defined under clause (112) of section 2, excluding the turnover of services; and (b) the turnover of zerorated supply of services determined in terms of clause (D) above and non-zero-rated supply of services, excluding- (i) the value of exempt supplies other than zero-rated supplies; and (ii) the turnover of supplies in respect of which refund is claimed under sub-rule (4A) or sub-rule (4B) or both, if any, during the relevant period.
(F) "Relevant period" means the period for which the claim has been filed.

# Calculation of the refundable amount on the GST Portal 

The common portal calculates the refundable amount as the least of the following amounts:
(i) The maximum refund amount as per the formula in rule Rule 89(5) of the CGST Rules [formula is applied on the consolidated amount of ITC, i.e. Central tax + State tax/Union Territory tax +Integrated tax];
(ii) The balance in the electronic credit ledger of the applicant at the end of the tax period for which the refund claim is being filed after the return in FORM GSTR-3B for the said period has been filed; and
(iii) The balance in the electronic credit ledger of the applicant at the time of filing the refund application.

After calculating the least of the three amounts, as detailed above, the equivalent amount is to be debited from the electronic credit ledger of the applicant in the following order:
a) Integrated tax, to the extent of balance available;
b) Central tax and State tax/Union Territory tax, equally to the extent of balance available and in the event of a shortfall in the balance available in a particular electronic credit ledger (say, Central tax), the differential amount is to be debited from the other electronic credit ledger (i.e., State tax/Union Territory tax, in this case).

## Scrutiny of refund application for unutilised ITC on account of inverted duty structure

There have been instances where, while processing the refund of unutilized ITC on account of inverted tax structure, some of the tax authorities denied the refund of ITC of GST paid on those inputs which are procured at equal or lower rate of GST than the rate of GST on outward supply, by not including the amount of such ITC while calculating the maximum refund amount as specified in rule 89(5) of the CGST Rules. The following issues are clarified:

a) Refund of unutilized ITC in case of inverted tax structure, as provided in section 54(3) of the CGST is available where ITC remains unutilized even after setting off of available ITC for the payment of output tax liability. Where there are multiple inputs attracting different rates of tax, in the formula provided in rule 89(5) of the CGST Rules, the term "Net ITC" covers the ITC availed on all inputs in the relevant period, irrespective of their rate of tax.
b) The calculation of refund of accumulated ITC on account of inverted tax structure, in cases where several inputs are used in supplying the final product/output, can be clearly understood with the help of following example:

Suppose a manufacturing process involves the use of an input A (attracting 5 per cent GST) and input B (attracting 18 per cent GST) to manufacture output Y (attracting 12 per cent GST). The refund of accumulated ITC in the situation above, will be available under section 54(3) of the CGST Act read with rule 89(5) of the CGST Rules, which prescribes the formula for the maximum refund amount permissible in such situations.

Further assume that the applicant supplies the output Y having value of Rs. 3,000/- during the relevant period for which the refund is being claimed. Therefore, the turnover of inverted rated supply of goods and services will be Rs. 3,000/-. Since the applicant has no other outward supplies, his adjusted total turnover will also be Rs. 3,000/-.

If we assume that Input A, having value of Rs. 500/- and Input B, having value of Rs. 2,000/-, have been purchased in the relevant period for the manufacture of Y, then Net ITC shall be equal to Rs. 385/- (Rs. 25/- and Rs. 360/- on Input A and Input B respectively).

Therefore, multiplying Net ITC by the ratio of turnover of inverted rated supply of goods and services to the adjusted total turnover will give the figure of Rs. 385/-.

From this, if we deduct the tax payable on such an inverted rated supply of goods or services, which is Rs. 360/-, we get the maximum refund amount, as per rule 89(5) of the CGST Rules which is Rs. 25/-.
![img-22.jpeg](img-22.jpeg.png)

The refund of unutilized ITC on account of inverted duty structure is not applicable in cases where the inversion is due to change in the GST rate on the same goods. A refund of accumulated ITC under clause (ii) of sub-section (3) of section 54 of the CGST Act would not be applicable in cases where the input and the output supplies are the same.

# Re-crediting of electronic credit ledger on account of rejection of refund claim 

In case of rejection of refund claim of unutilized/accumulated ITC due to ineligibility of the input tax credit under any provisions of the CGST Act and rules made thereunder, the proper officer shall have to issue a show cause notice in FORM GST RFD-08, under section 54 of the CGST Act, read with section 73 or 74 of the CGST Act, requiring the applicant to show cause as to why: (a) the refund amount corresponding to the ineligible ITC should not be rejected as per the relevant provisions of the law; and (b) the amount of ineligible ITC should not be recovered as wrongly availed ITC under section 73 or section 74 of the CGST Act, as the case may be, along with interest and penalty, if any.

The above notice shall be adjudicated following the principles of natural justice and an order shall be issued, in FORM GST RFD-06, under section 54 of the CGST Act, read with section 73 or section 74 of the CGST Act, as the case may be. If the adjudicating authority decides against the applicant in respect of both points (a) and (b) above, then FORM GST RFD-06 shall have to be issued accordingly, and the amount of ineligible ITC, along with interest and penalty, if any, shall be entered by the officer in the electronic liability register of the applicant through issuance of FORM GST DRC-07. Alternatively, the applicant can voluntarily pay this amount, along with interest and penalty, as applicable, before service of the demand notice, and intimate the same to the proper officer in FORM GST DRC-03 in accordance with sub-section (5) of section 73 or sub-section (5) of section 74 of the CGST Act, as the case may be, read with sub rule (2) of rule 142 of the CGST Rules. In such cases, the need for serving a demand notice for recovery of ineligible ITC will be obviated. In any case, the proper officer shall order for the rejected amount to be recredited to the electronic credit ledger of the applicant using FORM GST PMT03, only after the receipt of an undertaking from the applicant to the effect that he shall not file an appeal or in case he files an appeal, the same is finally decided against the applicant.

In case of rejection of a claim for refund, on account of any reason other than the ineligibility of credit, the process described above shall be followed with the only difference that there shall be no proceedings for recovery of ineligible ITC under section 73 or section 74 , as the case may be.

Example: Against a refund claim of unutilized/accumulated ITC of Rs.100/-, only Rs.80/- is sanctioned (Rs.15/- is rejected on account of ineligible ITC and Rs.5/- is rejected on account of any other reason). As stated above, a show cause notice, in FORM GST RFD-08 shall have to be issued to the applicant, requiring him to show cause as to why the refund claim amounting to Rs.20/should not be rejected under the relevant provisions of the law and why the ineligible ITC of Rs. 15/- should not be recovered under section 73 or section 74 , as the case may be, with interest and penalty, if any. If the said notice is decided against the applicant, Rs. 15/-, along with interest and penalty, if any, shall be entered by the officer in the electronic liability register of the applicant through issuance of FORM GST DRC-07. Further, Rs. 20/- would be re-credited through FORM GST PMT-03 only after the receipt of an undertaking from the applicant to the effect that he shall not file an appeal or in case he files an appeal, the same is finally decided against the applicant.

# Debit of electronic credit ledger using FORM GST DRC-03 

Q-1: Certain registered persons have reversed, through return in FORM GSTR-3B filed for the month of August, 2018 or for a subsequent month, the accumulated input tax credit (ITC) required to be lapsed in terms of notification No. 20/2018Central Tax (Rate) dated 26.07.2018 read with circular No. 56/30/2018-GST dated 24.08.2018 (hereinafter referred to as the "said notification"). Some of these registered persons, who have attempted to claim refund of accumulated ITC on account of inverted tax structure for the same period in which the ITC required to be lapsed in terms of the said notification has been reversed, are not able to claim refund of accumulated ITC to the extent to which they are so eligible. This is because of a validation check on the common portal which prevents the value of input tax credit in Statement 1A of

FORM GST RFD-01A from being higher than the amount of ITC availed in FORM GSTR-3B of the relevant period minus the value of ITC reversed in the same period. This results in registered persons being unable to claim the full amount of refund of accumulated ITC on account of inverted tax structure to which they might be otherwise eligible. What is the solution to this problem?

Reply: - As a one-time measure to resolve this issue, refund of accumulated ITC on account of inverted tax structure, for the period(s) in which there is reversal of the ITC required to be lapsed in terms of the said notification, is to be claimed under the category "any other" instead of under the category "refund of unutilized ITC on account of accumulation due to inverted tax structure" in FORM GST RFD-01A. This application for refund should relate to the same tax period in which such reversal has been made.

The application shall be accompanied by all statements, declarations, undertakings and other documents which are statutorily required to be submitted with a "refund claim of unutilized ITC on account of accumulation due to inverted tax structure". On receiving the said application, the proper officer shall himself calculate the refund amount admissible as per rule 89(5) of Central Goods and Services Tax Rules, 2017 (hereinafter referred to as "CGST Rules"), in the manner prescribed. After calculating the admissible refund amount and scrutinizing the application for completeness and eligibility, if the proper officer is satisfied that the whole or any part of the amount claimed is payable as refund, he shall request the taxpayer, in writing, to debit the said amount from his electronic credit ledger through FORM GST DRC-03. Once the proof of such debit is received by the proper officer, he shall proceed to issue the refund order in FORM GST RFD 06 and the payment order in FORM GST RFD-05.

All refund applications for unutilized ITC on account of accumulation due to inverted tax structure for subsequent tax period(s) shall be filed in FORM GST RFD-01 under the category "refund of unutilized ITC on account of accumulation due to inverted tax structure".

Q-2: The clarification given for Q-1 above applies to registered persons who have already reversed the ITC required to be lapsed in terms of the said

notification through return in FORM GSTR-3B. What about those registered persons who are yet to perform this reversal?

Reply: All those registered persons required to make the reversal in terms of the said notification and who have not yet done so, may reverse the said amount through FORM GST DRC-03 instead of through FORM GSTR-3B.

Q-3: What shall be the consequence if any registered person reverses the amount of credit to be lapsed, in terms the said notification, through the return in FORM GSTR-3B for any month subsequent to August, 2018 or through FORM GST DRC-03 subsequent to the due date of filing of the return in FORM GSTR-3B for the month of August, 2018?

Reply: As the registered person has reversed the amount of credit to be lapsed in the return in FORM GSTR-3B for a month subsequent to the month of August, 2018 or through FORM GST DRC-03 subsequent to the due date of filing of the return in FORM GSTR-3B for the month of August, 2018, he shall be liable to pay interest under sub-section (1) of section 50 of the CGST Act on the amount which has been reversed belatedly. Such interest shall be calculated starting from the due date of filing of return in FORM GSTR-3B for the month of August, 2018 till the date of reversal of said amount through FORM GSTR-3B or through FORM GST DRC03, as the case may be.

The registered person who has reversed the amount of credit to be lapsed in the return in FORM GSTR-3B for any month subsequent to August, 2018 or through FORM GST DRC-03 subsequent to the due date of filing of the return in FORM GSTR-3B for the month of August, 2018 would remain eligible to claim refund of unutilized ITC on account of accumulation due to inverted tax structure w.e.f. 01.08.2018. However, such refund shall be granted only after the reversal of the amount of credit to be lapsed, either through FORM GSTR3B or FORM GST DRC-03, along with payment of interest, as applicable.

Q-4: How should a merchant exporter claim refund of input tax credit availed on supplies received on which the supplier has availed the benefit of the Government of India, Ministry of Finance, notification No. 40/2017-Central Tax (Rate), dated the 23rd October, 2017, or notification No. 41/2017-Integrated

Tax (Rate), dated the 23rd October, 2017 (hereinafter referred to as the "said notifications")?

Reply: Rule 89(4B) of the CGST Rules provides that where the person claiming refund of unutilized input tax credit on account of zero-rated supplies without payment of tax has received supplies on which the supplier has availed the benefit of the said notifications, the refund of input tax credit, availed in respect of such inputs received under the said notifications for export of goods, shall be granted.

This refund of accumulated ITC under rule 89(4B) of the CGST Rules shall be applied under the category "any other" instead of under the category "refund of unutilized ITC on account of exports without payment of tax" in FORM GST RFD-01 and shall be accompanied by all supporting documents required for substantiating the refund claim under the category "refund of unutilized ITC on account of exports without payment of tax". After scrutinizing the application for completeness and eligibility, if the proper officer is satisfied that the whole or any part of the amount claimed is payable as refund, he shall request the taxpayer, in writing, to debit the said amount from his electronic credit ledger through FORM GST DRC-03. Once the proof of such debit is received by the proper officer, he shall proceed to issue the refund order in FORM GST RFD-06 and the payment order in FORM GST RFD-05.

# Disbursal of refunds 

For a refund application assigned to a Central tax officer, both the sanction order (FORM GST RFD-04/06) and the corresponding payment order (FORM GST RFD-05) for the sanctioned refund amount, under all tax heads (CGST/SGST/IGST/Cess), shall be issued by the Central tax officer only. Similarly, for refund applications assigned to a State/UT tax officer, both the sanction order (FORM GST RFD04/06) and the corresponding payment order (FORM GST RFD-05) for the sanctioned refund amount, under all tax heads (CGST/SGST/IGST/Cess), shall be issued by the State/UT tax officer only.

The sanctioned refund amounts, as entered in the payment orders issued by the Central and State/UT tax officers, shall be disbursed through the Public Financial Management System (PFMS) of the Controller General of Accounts (CGA), Ministry of Finance, Government of India.

On filing of a refund application in FORM GST RFD-01, the common portal shall generate a master file for the applicant containing the relevant details like name, GSTIN, bank account details etc. This master file shall be shared with PFMS for validation of the bank account details provided by the applicant in the refund application. Once the bank account is validated, PFMS will create a unique assessee code (combination of GSTIN + validated bank account number) for the applicant. This unique assessee code will be used by PFMS for all refund payments made to the applicant in the said bank account. Therefore, in order to avoid repeat validations and generation of multiple unique assessee codes for the same GSTIN, it shall be advisable for the applicants to enter the same bank account details in successive refund applications submitted in FORM GST RFD-01.

In cases where an applicant wishes to avail the refund in a different bank account, which has not yet been validated, a new unique assessee code (comprising of GSTIN + new bank account) will be generated by PFMS after validation of the said bank account. If the bank account details mentioned by an applicant in the refund application submitted in FORM GST RFD-01 are invalidated, an error message shall be transmitted by PFMS to the common

portal electronically and the common portal shall make the error message available to the applicant and the refund officers on their dashboards. On receiving such an error message, an applicant can:
(i) rectify the invalidated bank account details by filing a non-core amendment in FORM GST REG-14; or
(ii) add a new bank account by filing a non-core amendment in FORM GST REG-14

The updated bank account details will be reflected in a drop-down menu on the dashboard. From this drop-down menu, the applicant can choose any bank account, including the ones rectified (option (a)) or newly added (option (b)), from the list of bank accounts available in his registration database. The chosen bank account details will again be sent to PFMS for validation. The proper officer will be able to issue the payment order in FORM GST RFD-05 only after the selected bank account has been validated.

By following the above process, validation errors, if any, will generally be corrected before the issuance of payment order in FORM GST RFD-05. Therefore, there should generally not be any validation errors after issuance of a payment order in FORM GST RFD-05. However, in certain exceptional cases, it is possible that a validation error occurs after issuance of the payment order. In such cases, the said payment order will be invalidated by the common portal and a new payment order will have to be issued by the proper officer after following the rectification process described above. The re-issued payment order will have a new reference number and shall contain the newly selected bank account details. However, there will be no change in either the original ARN or the sanction order number or the amount for which the payment order was originally issued.

It may be noted that the applicant, at the time of filing of refund application in FORM GST RFD-01, can select a bank account only from the list of bank accounts provided by him at the time of registration in FORM GST REG-01, or subsequently through filing a non-core amendment in FORM GST REG-14. The same account details will be auto-populated in the payment order issued in

FORM GST RFD-05. Any change in these auto-populated bank account details shall not be allowed unless there is a validation error in relation to the same.

The disbursement status of the refund amount would be communicated by PFMS to the common portal. The common portal shall notify the same to the taxpayer by email/SMS. Such details shall also be available on the status tracking facility on the dashboard.

# Disbursal of refund when no debit is made in the Electronic Credit Ledger 

For the refund of tax paid falling under the following categories, no separate debit of ITC from electronic credit ledger is required to be made by the applicant at the time of filing refund claim, being claim of tax already paid.
(i) Refund of excess payment of tax;
(ii) Refund of tax paid on intra-State supply which is subsequently held to be inter-State supply and vice versa;
(iii) Refund on account of assessment/provisional assessment/appeal/any other order;
(iv) Refund on account of "any other" ground or reason

The total tax would have been normally paid by the applicant by debiting tax amount from both electronic credit ledger and electronic cash ledger. By default, in these cases, the amount of admissible refund, is paid in cash even when such payment of tax or any part thereof, has been made through ITC. In order to avoid unintended encashment of credit balances, Notification No.16/2020-Central Tax dated 23.03.2020, has inserted sub-rule (4A) in rule 86 of the CGST Rules, 2017 which reads as under:
"(4A) Where a registered person has claimed refund of any amount paid as tax wrongly paid or paid in excess for which debit has been made from the electronic credit ledger, the said amount, if found admissible, shall be re-credited to the electronic credit ledger by the proper officer by an order made in FORM GST PMT-03."

Further, vide the same notification, sub-rule (1A) has also been inserted in rule 92 of the CGST Rules, 2017 which reads as follows:
"(1A)Where, upon examination of the application of refund of any amount paid as tax other than the refund of tax paid on zero-rated supplies or deemed export, the proper officer is satisfied that a refund under sub-section (5) of section 54 of the Act is due and payable to the applicant, he shall make an order in FORM RFD-06 sanctioning the amount of refund to be paid, in cash, proportionate to the amount debited in cash against the total amount paid for discharging tax liability for the relevant period, mentioning therein the amount adjusted against any outstanding demand under the Act or under any existing law and the balance amount refundable and for the remaining amount which has been debited from the electronic credit ledger for making payment of such tax, the proper officer shall issue FORM GST PMT-03 recrediting the said amount as Input Tax Credit in electronic credit ledger."

The combined effect the abovementioned changes is that any such refund of tax paid on supplies other than zero rated supplies will now be admissible proportionately in the respective original mode of payment i.e. in cases of refund, where the tax to be refunded has been paid by debiting both electronic cash and credit ledgers (other than the refund of tax paid on zero-rated supplies or deemed export), the refund to be paid in cash and credit shall be calculated in the same proportion in which the cash and credit ledger has been debited for discharging the total tax liability for the relevant period for which application for refund has been filed. Such amount, shall be accordingly paid by issuance of order in FORM GST RFD-06 for amount refundable in cash and FORM GST PMT-03 to re-credit the amount attributable to credit as ITC in the electronic credit ledger.

# Clarifications on other refund related issues 

Merchant Exporter

Notification No. 40/2017 - Central Tax (Rate) and notification No. 41/2017 Integrated Tax (Rate) both dated 23.10.2017 provide for supplies for exports at a concessional rate of $0.05 \%$ and $0.1 \%$ respectively, subject to certain conditions specified in the said notifications. It is clarified that the benefit of supplies at concessional rate is subject to certain conditions and the said benefit is optional. The option may or may not be availed by the supplier and / or the recipient and the goods may be procured at the normal applicable tax rate. It is also clarified that the exporter will be eligible to take credit of the tax @ $0.05 \% / 0.1 \%$ paid by him. The supplier who supplies goods at the concessional rate is also eligible for refund on account of inverted tax structure as per the provisions of clause (ii) of the first proviso to sub-section (3) of section 54 of the CGST Act. It may also be noted that the exporter of such goods can export the goods only under LUT / bond and cannot export on payment of Integrated tax.

## Monetary Limit for Claiming Refund

Sub-section (14) of section 54 of the CGST Act provides that no refund under subsection (5) or sub-section (6) of section 54 of the CGST Act shall be paid to an applicant, if the amount is less than one thousand rupees. In this regard, it is clarified that the limit of rupees one thousand shall be applied for each tax head separately and not cumulatively.

## Interpretation of "Net ITC"

Presently, ITC is reflected in the electronic credit ledger on the basis of the amount of the ITC availed on self-declaration basis in FORM GSTR-3B for a

particular tax period. It may happen that the goods purchased against a particular tax invoice issued in a particular month, say August 2018, may be declared in the FORM GSTR-3B filed for a subsequent month, say September 2018. This is inevitable in cases where the supplier raises an invoice, say in August, 2018, and the goods reach the recipient's premises in September, 2018. Since GST law mandates that ITC can be availed only after the goods have been received, the recipient can only avail the ITC on such goods in the FORM GSTR-3B filed for the month of September, 2018. In this regard, it is clarified that "Net ITC" as defined in rule 89(4) of the CGST Rules means input tax credit availed on inputs and input services during the relevant period. Relevant period means the period for which the refund claim has been filed. Input tax credit can be said to have been "availed" when it is entered into the electronic credit ledger of the registered person. Under the current dispensation, this happens when the said taxable person files his/her monthly return in FORM GSTR-3B. Further, section 16(4) of the CGST Act stipulates that ITC may be claimed on or before the due date of filing of the return for the month of September following the financial year to which the invoice pertains or the date of filing of annual return, whichever is earlier. Therefore, the input tax credit of invoices issued in August, 2019, "availed" in September, 2019 cannot be excluded from the calculation of the refund amount for the month of September, 2019.62.

# Eligibility of ITC on stores, spares and packing material as Net ITC 

It has been represented that on certain occasions, departmental officers do not consider ITC on stores and spares, packing materials, materials purchased for machinery repairs, printing and stationery items, as part of Net ITC on the grounds that these are not directly consumed in the manufacturing process and therefore, do not qualify as input. There are also instances where stores and spares charged to revenue are considered as capital goods and therefore the ITC availed on them is not included in Net ITC, even though the value of these goods has not been capitalized in his books of account by the applicant.

It is clarified that the ITC of the GST paid on inputs, including inward supplies of stores and spares, packing materials etc., shall be available as ITC as long as these inputs are used for the purpose of the business and/or for effecting taxable supplies, including zero-rated supplies, and the ITC for such inputs is not restricted under section 17(5) of the CGST Act. Further, capital goods have been clearly defined in section 2(19) of the CGST Act as goods whose value has been capitalized in the books of account and which are used or intended to be used in the course or furtherance of business. Stores and spares, the expenditure on which has been charged as a revenue expense in the books of account, cannot be held to be capital goods.

Tax deducted in accordance with the provisions of section 51 of the CGST Act or tax collected in accordance with the provisions of section 52 of the CGST Act is required to be paid while discharging the liability in FORM GSTR 7 or FORM GSTR 8, as the case may be, by the deductor or the collector, as the case may be.

There are instances where taxes so deducted or collected is deposited under the wrong head (e.g. an amount deducted as Central tax is deposited as Integrated tax/State tax), thereby creating excess balance in the cash ledger of the deductor or the collector as the case may be.

Such excess balance may be claimed by the tax deductor or the collector as the excess balance in electronic cash ledger. In this case, the common portal would debit the amount so claimed as refund. However, in case where tax deducted or collected in excess is also paid while discharging the liability in FORM GSTR 7 or FORM GSTR 8, as the case may be, and the said amount has been credited to the electronic cash ledger of the deductee, the deductee can adjust the same while discharging his output liability or he can claim refund of the same under the category "refund of excess balance in the electronic cash ledger".

# Refund of Tax paid under the wrong head 

The provisions of CGST/SGST Act, enables a taxpayer to claim for a refund of the tax paid for the intra-state supply which is consequently held to be interstate supply and vice versa. Refund can be claimed on the GST Portal using refund option as "Refund on tax paid on an Intra state supply which is subsequently held to be inter-state supply and vice versa", if an order is issued by the tax officer against which the refund is arising due to change in PoS (place of supply) of a particular transaction.

The applicant need not make any debit from the Electronic Credit Ledger at the time of filing refund claim since tax is already paid. However, the total tax would have been normally paid by the applicant by debiting tax amount from both electronic credit ledger and electronic cash ledger. In these cases, the amount of admissible refund, was paid in cash even when such payment of tax or any part thereof, has been made through ITC.

With the intention of preventing unintended encashment of credit balances, Notification No.16/2020-Central Tax dated 23.03.2020 inserted sub-rule (4A) in rule 86 of the CGST Rules, 2017 which reads as under:
"Where a registered person has claimed refund of any amount paid as tax wrongly paid or paid in excess for which debit has been made from the electronic credit ledger, the said amount, if found admissible, shall be re-credited to the electronic credit ledger by the proper officer by an order made in FORM GST PMT-03."

Further, vide the same notification, sub-rule (1A) has also been inserted in rule 92 of the CGST Rules, 2017.

As per GST Rule 92[1A] of the CGST Rules, 2017 - Where, upon examination of the application of refund of any amount paid as tax other than the refund of tax paid on zero-rated supplies or deemed export, the proper officer is satisfied that a refund under sub-section (5) of section 54 of the Act is due and payable to the applicant, he shall make an order in FORM RFD-06 sanctioning the amount of refund to be paid, in cash, proportionate to the amount debited

in cash against the total amount paid for discharging tax liability for the relevant period, mentioning therein the amount adjusted against any outstanding demand under the Act or under any existing law and the balance amount refundable and for the remaining amount which has been debited from the electronic credit ledger for making payment of such tax, the proper officer shall issue FORM GST PMT-03 re-crediting the said amount as Input Tax Credit in electronic credit ledger.

The combined effect of the Rule 86 (4A) and 92 (1A) is that refund of tax paid on supplies (other than zero rated supplies ) will now be admissible proportionately in the respective original mode of payment.

# Refund under the "Others" category 

A refund application under the category of "Others" can be filed on the GST Portal in the following circumstances:

A: Certain registered persons have reversed, through return in FORM GSTR-3B filed for the month of August, 2018 or for a subsequent month, the accumulated input tax credit (ITC) required to be lapsed in terms of notification No. 20/2018-Central Tax (Rate) dated 26.07.2018 read with circular No. 56/30/2018-GST dated 24.08.2018. Some of these registered persons, who have attempted to claim refund of accumulated ITC on account of inverted tax structure for the same period in which the ITC required to be lapsed in terms of the said notification has been reversed, are not able to claim refund of accumulated ITC to the extent to which they are so eligible. This is because of a validation check on the common portal which prevents the value of input tax credit in Statement 1A of FORM GST RFD-01Afrom being higher than the amount of ITC availed in FORM GSTR-3B of the relevant period minus the value of ITC reversed in the same period. This results in registered persons being unable to claim the full amount of refund of accumulated ITC on account of inverted tax structure to which they might be otherwise eligible.

As a one-time measure to resolve this issue, a refund of accumulated ITC on account of inverted tax structure, for the period (s) in which there is reversal of the ITC required to be lapsed in terms of the said notification, is to be claimed under the category "any other" instead of under the category "refund of unutilized ITC on account of accumulation due to inverted tax structure" in FORM GST RFD-01A. It is emphasized that this application for refund should relate to the same tax period in which such reversal has been made.

The application shall be accompanied by all statements, declarations, undertakings, and other documents that are statutorily required to be submitted with a "refund claim of unutilizedITC on account of

accumulation due to inverted tax structure". On receiving the said application, the proper officer shall himself calculate the refund amount admissible as per rule 89(5) of Central Goods and Services Tax Rules, 2017 (hereinafter referred to as "CGST Rules"), in the manner detailed in para 3 of Circular No. 59/33/2018-GST dated 04.09.2018. After calculating the admissible refund amount, as described above, and scrutinizing the application for completeness and eligibility, if the proper officer is satisfied that the whole or any part of the amount claimed is payable as a refund, he shall request the taxpayer, in writing, to debit the said amount from his electronic credit ledger through FORM GST DRC-03. Once the proof of such debit is received by the proper officer, he shall proceed to issue the refund order in FORM GST RFD06and the payment advice in FORM GST RFD-05. c)All refund applications for unutilized ITC on account of accumulation due to inverted tax structure for subsequent tax period(s)shall be filed in FORM GST RFD-01A under the category "refund of unutilized ITC on account of accumulation due to inverted tax structure.

B: How should a merchant exporter claim refund of input tax credit availed on supplies received on which the supplier has availed the benefit of the Government of India, Ministry of Finance, notification No. 40/2017-Central Tax (Rate), dated the 23rd October, 2017, or notification No. 41/2017-Integrated Tax (Rate), dated the 23rd October, 2017 ?
a) Rule 89(4B) of the CGST Rules provides that where the person claiming refund of unutilized input tax credit on account of zero-rated supplies without payment of tax has received supplies on which the supplier has availed the benefit of the said notifications, the refund of input tax credit, availed in respect of such inputs received under the said notifications for export of goods, shall be granted.
b) This refund of accumulated ITC under rule 89(4B) of the CGST Rules shall be applied under the category "any other" instead of under the category "refund of unutilized ITC on account of exports without

payment of tax" in FORM GST RFD-01 and shall be accompanied by all supporting documents required for substantiating the refund claim under the category "refund of unutilized ITC on account of exports without payment of tax". After scrutinizing the application for completeness and eligibility, if the proper officer is satisfied that the whole or any part of the amount claimed is payable as refund, he shall request the taxpayer, in writing, to debit the said amount from his electronic credit ledger through FORM GST DRC-03. Once the proof of such debit is received by the proper officer, he shall proceed to issue the refund order in FORM GST RFD-06 and the payment order in FORM GST RFD-05.

# International Tourist Refunds 

Refund of taxes to the retail outlets established in the departure area of an international Airport beyond immigration counters making tax free supply to an outgoing international tourist.

The Central Government vide Notification No. 11 /2019 - Integrated Tax (Rate) dated 29th June 2019 exempted the supply of goods by a retail outlet established in the departure area of an international airport, beyond the immigration counters, to an outgoing international tourist, from the whole of the integrated tax leviable thereon under Section 5 of the Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017. The broad idea of bringing this notification into the picture was to exempt the output tax liability of these Duty-Free Shops located at the departure area of an international airport.

However, the corresponding implications of this notification resulted in mandatory reversals of Input Tax Credit under Rule 42 \& 43 of CGST Rules 2017, and accumulated taxes on inward supplies of 'indigenous goods'.

Hence, a series of notifications were issued by Central Government to allow refund under Section 55 of the taxes paid on the inward supplies of 'indigenous goods' received by the Duty-Free shops for the purposes of subsequent supply to outgoing international tourists i.e. to a person not normally resident in India, who enters India for a stay of not more than six months for legitimate non-immigrant purposes against foreign exchange (hereinafter referred to as the "eligible passengers").

The Central Government vide Notification No. 31 /2019 - Central Tax dated 28th June 2019 made amendment in Central Goods and Services Tax Rules, 2019 and inserted Rule 95A to allow refund of taxes to the retail outlets established in the departure area of an international Airport beyond immigration counters, making tax free supply to an outgoing international tourist.

The conditions, manner and procedure for filing and processing of such refund claims by the Duty-Free Shops established in the departure area of an

international airport, beyond the immigration counters, is outlined in Circular No 106/25/2019 GST dated 29.06.2019 as follows:
(i) Registration under CGST Act: The retail outlets applying for refund shall be registered under the provisions of section 22 of the CGST Act read with the rules made thereunder and shall have a valid GSTIN.
(ii) Location of retail outlets: Such retail outlets shall be established at departure area of the international airport beyond immigration counters and shall be entitled to claim a refund of all applicable Central tax, State tax, Integrated tax, Union territory tax and Compensation cess paid by them on all inward supplies of indigenous goods received for the purposes of the subsequent supply of such goods to the eligible passengers.
(iii) Maintenance of Records: The records with respect to duty paid indigenous goods being brought to the retail outlets and their supplies to eligible passengers shall be maintained as per Annexure A in electronic form. The data shall be kept updated, accurate and complete at all times by such retail outlets and shall be available for inspection/verification of the proper officer of central tax at any time.

(iv) Invoice-based refund: The refund to be granted to retail outlets is not on account of the accumulated input tax credit but is refund based on the invoices of the inward supplies of indigenous goods received by them. The supply made by such retail outlets to eligible passengers has been exempted vide notification No. 11/2019-Integrated Tax (Rate) and 01/2019Compensation Cess (Rate) both dated 29.06.2019 and therefore such retail outlets will not be eligible for input tax credit of taxes paid on such inward supplies and the same will have to be reversed in accordance the provisions of

the CGST Act read with the rules made thereunder. It is also clarified that no refund of tax paid on input services, if any, will be granted to the retail outlets.

(c) A passenger declaration as per Annexure B;
(d) A copy of the invoice clearly evidencing that no tax was charged from the eligible passenger by the retail outlet.
(vi) Display notice: The retail outlets will be required to prominently display a notice that international tourists are eligible for purchase of goods without payment of domestic taxes.
(vii) Manual filing of refund claims: In terms of rule 95A of the CGST Rules, the retail outlets are required to apply for refund on a monthly or quarterly basis depending upon the frequency of furnishing of return in FORM GSTR-3B. Till the time the online utility for filing the refund claim is made available on the common portal, these retail outlets shall apply for refund by filing an application in FORM GST RFD-10B, manually to the jurisdictional proper officer.
(viii) Supporting documents with refund application: The refund application in Form GST RFD 10B shall be accompanied with the following documents:
a) An undertaking by the retail outlets stating that the indigenous goods on which refund is being claimed have been received by such retail outlets;
b) An undertaking by the retail outlets stating that the indigenous goods on which refund is being claimed have been sold to eligible passengers;

c) Copies of the valid return furnished in FORM GSTR - 3B by the retail outlets for the period covered in the refund claim;
d) Copies of FORM GSTR-2A for the period covered in the refund claim; and
e) Copies of the attested hard copies of the invoices on which refund is claimed but which are not reflected in FORM GSTR-2A
(ix) Processing and sanction of the refund claim: Upon receipt of the complete application in FORM GST RFD-10B, an acknowledgement shall be issued manually by the proper officer within 15 days of the receipt of application in FORM GST RFD-02. In case of any deficiencies or any additional information is required, the same shall be communicated to the retail outlets by issuing a deficiency memo manually in FORM GST RFD-03 by the proper officer within 15 days of the receipt of the refund application. Only one deficiency memo should be issued against one refund application which is complete in all respects. The proper officer shall validate the GSTIN details on the common portal to ascertain whether the return in FORM GSTR- 3B has been filed by the retail outlets. The proper officer may scrutinize the details contained in FORM RFD-10B, FORM GSTR-3B and FORM GSTR-2A. The proper officer may rely upon FORM GSTR-2A as an evidence to account for the supply received by them in relation to which the refund has been claimed by the retail outlets. The retail outlets would be required to submit hard copies of only those invoices of inward supplies that have not been reflected in FORM GSTR-2A. The proper officer shall issue the refund order manually in FORM GST RFD-06 along with the manual payment advice in FORM GST RFD-05 for each head i.e., Central tax/State tax/Union territory tax/Integrated tax/Compensation Cess. The amount of sanctioned refund along with the bank account details of the retail outlets shall be manually submitted in the PFMS system by the jurisdictional Division DDO and a signed copy of the sanction order shall be sent to the PAO for disbursal of the said amount. Where any refund has been made in respect of an invoice without the tax having been paid to the Government or where the supply of such goods was not made to an eligible passenger, such amount refunded shall be recovered along with

interest as per the provisions contained in section 73 or section 74 of the CGST Act, as the case may be.

No. 10(1)/2017-DBAII/NER, dated 5-10-2017

Subject: Scheme of budgetary support under Goods and Services Tax Regime to the units located in States of Jammu \& Kashmir, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and North East including Sikkim.

In pursuance of the decision of the Government of India to provide budgetary support to the existing eligible manufacturing units operating in the States of Jammu \& Kashmir, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and North Eastern States including Sikkim under different Industrial Promotion Schemes of the Government of India, for a residual period for which each of the units is eligible, a new scheme is being introduced. The new scheme is offered, as a measure of goodwill, only to the units which were eligible for drawing benefits under the earlier excise duty exemption/refund schemes but has otherwise no relation to the erstwhile schemes.
1.2 Units which were eligible under the erstwhile Schemes and were in operation through exemption notifications issued by the Department of Revenue in the Ministry of Finance, as listed under para 2 below would be considered eligible under this scheme. All such notifications have ceased to apply w.e.f. 1-7-2017 and stands rescinded on 18-7-2017 vide notification no. 21/2017, dated 18-7-2017. The scheme shall be limited to the tax which accrues to the Central Government under Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 and Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017, after devolution of the Central tax or the Integrated tax to the States, in terms of Article 270 of the Constitution.
2. The erstwhile Schemes which were in operation on 18-7-2017 were as follows :

2.1 Jammu \& Kashmir - Notification nos. 56/2002-C.E., dated 14-11-2002, 57/2002-C.E., dated 14-11-2002 and 01/2010-C.E., dated 6-2-2010 as amended from time to time;
2.2 Himachal Pradesh \& Uttarakhand - Notification nos. 49/2003-C.E., dated 10-6-2003 and 50/2003-C.E., dated 10-6-2003 as amended from time to time;
2.3 North East States including Sikkim - Notification no. 20/2007-C.E., dated 25-4-2007 as amended from time to time.

# 3. SHORT TITLE AND COMMENCEMENT 

3.1 The scheme shall be called Scheme of Budgetary Support under Goods and Services Tax (GST) Regime to the units located in State of Jammu \& Kashmir, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and North Eastern States including Sikkim. The said Scheme shall come into operation w.e.f. 1-7-2017 for an eligible unit (as defined in para 4.1) and shall remain in operation for residual period (as defined in para 4.3) for each of the eligible unit in respect of specified goods (as defined in para 4.2). The overall scheme shall be valid upto 30-6-2027.

### 3.2 OBJECTIVE:

The GST Council in its meeting held on 30-9-2016 had noted that exemption from payment of indirect tax under any existing tax incentive scheme of Central or State Governments shall not continue under the GST regime and the concerned units shall be required to pay tax in the GST regime. The Council left it to the discretion of Central and State Governments to notify schemes of budgetary support to such units. Accordingly, the Central Government in recognition of the hardships arising due to withdrawal of above exemption notifications has decided that it would provide budgetary support to the eligible units for the residual period by way of part reimbursement of the Goods and Services Tax, paid by the unit limited to the Central Government's share of CGST and/or IGST retained after devolution of a part of these taxes to the States.

# 4. DEFINITIONS

4.3 'Residual period' means the remaining period out of the total period not exceeding ten years, from the date of commencement of commercial production, as specified under the relevant notification listed in paragraph 2, during which the eligible unit would have been eligible to avail exemption for the specified goods. The documentary evidence regarding date of commercial production shall be submitted in terms of para 5.7.

# 5. DETERMINATION OF THE AMOUNT OF BUDGETARY SUPPORT 

5.1 The amount of budgetary support under the scheme for specified goods manufactured by the eligible unit shall be sum total of -
(i) $58 \%$ of the Central tax paid through debit in the cash ledger account maintained by the unit in terms of sub-section (1) of section 49 the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 after utilization of the Input tax credit of the Central Tax and Integrated Tax.
(ii) $29 \%$ of the integrated tax paid through debit in the cash ledger account maintained by the unit in terms of section 20 of the Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 after utilization of the Input tax credit Tax of the Central Tax and Integrated Tax.

Provided where inputs are procured from a registered person operating under the Composition Scheme under Section 10 of the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 the amount i.e. sum total of (i) \& (ii) above shall be reduced by the same percentage as is the percentage value of inputs procured under Composition scheme out of total value of inputs procured.

## Explanation:-

Explanation-I
a Sum total worked out under clause (i) \& (ii) Rs. 200
b Percentage value of inputs procured under $20 \%$
Composition Scheme out of total value of inputs procured
c Admissible amount out of (a) above Rs. (200-20\% of 200) = Rs. 160

Explanation-II
(a) Calculation of (ii) shall be followed by calculation of (i)

(b) To avail benefit of this scheme, eligible unit shall first utilize input tax credit of Central tax and Integrated tax and balance of liability, if any, shall be paid in cash and where this condition is not fulfilled, the reimbursement sanctioning officer shall reduce the amount of budgetary support payable to the extent credit of Central tax and integrated tax, is not utilized for payment of tax.

Area Based exemption - Manual disbursal of budgetary support under GST Regime to the units located in States of Jammu \& Kashmir, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and North East including Sikkim Procedure - Circular No. 1060/9/2017-CX., dated 27-11-2017
F.No: 116/15/2017-CX 3

Government of India
Ministry of Finance (Department of Revenue)
Central Board of Excise \& Customs, New Delhi

Subject: Procedure for manual disbursal of budgetary support under Goods and Services Tax Regime to the units located in States of Jammu \& Kashmir, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and North East including Sikkim Regarding.

As you are aware, under the Central Excise regime as its existed prior to 1-72017, the units located in the states of Jammu \& Kashmir, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and North East including Sikkim were eligible to avail exempt ion from payment of Central Excise duty in terms of area based exemption notifications. While $a b$ initio exemption was available to the units located in the States of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh, the units located in other aforesaid areas were required to pay Central Excise duty and avail exemption by way of refund of cash component of such duty paid.
2. Under GST regime there is no such exemption and the existing units which were availing exemption from payment of Central Excise duty prior to 1-7-2017 are required to pay CGST \& SGST/IGST like a normal unit. Thus, presently no exemption is available to these units by way of either $a b$ initio exemption or by way of refund.
3. In order to obviate the hardships faced by such units, Central Government has decided to provide budgetary support to the eligible units which were operating under erstwhile Area Based Exemption Schemes, for the residual period for which the units would have operated under the schemes, by way of refund of the Goods and Services tax, limited to its share of

CGST and/or IGST retained after devolution of taxes to the states. In this regard Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP), Ministry of Commerce \& Industry which is the administrative department for the scheme, has issued a notification dated 5-10-2017 regarding "Scheme of budgetary support under Goods and Service Tax Regime to the units located in States of Jammu \& Kashmir, Uttrakhand, Himachal Pradesh and North East including Sikkim." The gazette copy of the scheme, issued on 11-10-2017, can be accessed from website www.e-gazette.nic.in under Ministry of Commerce and Industry. The new scheme is introduced as a measure of goodwill, only to the units which were eligible for availing benefits under the earlier excise duty exemption/refund schemes but has otherwise no relation to the erstwhile schemes. The scheme of budgetary support has come into operation w.e.f. 1-72017 for an eligible unit (as defined under para 4.1 of the scheme) and shall remain in operation for residual period (as defined in para 4.3 of the scheme) in respect of specified goods (as defined in para 4.2 of the scheme). Budgetary support under the scheme shall be worked out on quarterly basis and claims for the same shall also be filed on a quarterly basis viz. April to June, July to September, October to December and January to March. The manner and method for determination of amount of Budgetary Support, recovery procedure thereof, etc. has been enumerated in the scheme.
4. The amount of such budgetary support under the scheme for specified goods manufactured by the eligible units shall be determined in terms of para 5 of the scheme and shall be the sum total of (i) $58 \%$ of the Central tax paid through debit in the cash ledger account maintained by the units in terms of sub-section (1) of section 49 of the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 and (ii) $29 \%$ of the integrated tax paid through debit in the cash ledger account maintained by the units in terms of section 20 of the Integrated Goods and Services Act, 2017. However, where inputs are procured from a registered person operating under Composition Scheme under Section 10 of the Central Goods and Services Act, 2017 the amount, i.e. sum total of (i) \& (ii) above shall be reduced by the same percentage as is the percentage value of inputs procured under Composition scheme out of the total value of inputs.
5. The budgetary support shall be disbursed from the budgetary

allocation of DIPP, which shall further allocate to PAO, C.B.E. \& C. for its disposal. The eligible unit is required to obtain one time registration and file an application for payment of budgetary support. The application shall be processed by the Deputy/Assistant Commissioner of the Central Taxes for sanction of the admissible amount. The sanctioned amount shall be credited into bank accounts of the beneficiaries through PFMS platform of the Central Government.
6. The claim for the quarter ending September, 2017 has already become due. In order to mitigate the difficulties of the eligible units, it has been decided that units would be registered on the basis of application filed by them manually and application for claim of budgetary support for the said quarter would also be filed and processed manually. The approval of the registration for the scheme and processing of the application for budgetary support for the quarter shall also be undertaken manually by the jurisdictional Deputy Commissioner/Assistant Commissioner of the Central Tax. The sanctioned amount shall be credited into the bank accounts of the beneficiaries through the PFMS platform in a manner fully compliant with the direct transfer of the benefit to the account of the assessee.
7. The standard operating procedure for the claims relating to the first quarter ending September, 2017 shall be as per para 8 to para 9 below.

# 8. Registration of the eligible units under the scheme 

(i) The application for registration under the scheme by the eligible units shall be submitted in triplicate in the format attached to this circular. The application shall be signed by the proprietor/partner/managing director of the eligible unit or by the person authorized by him in this behalf and supported by the selfauthenticated copies of the documents in support of information as per the application. The registration under GST is a necessary prerequisite for the scheme.
(ii) In case more than one eligible unit is operating under the same GSTIN, separate registration is required to be obtained for each of the eligible units.
(iii) The jurisdictional Deputy Commissioner/Assistant Commissioner of

the Central Taxes would examine the application in terms of the scheme as notified on the basis of documents submitted along with the application for registration.

This would ensure validation of the Bank Account details of the beneficiary. This exercise should be completed within 3 days of receipt of the copy of application by the DDO.
(vii) The third copy of the application after registration shall be forwarded to the ADG, DG Audit, Delhi who in turn would be providing the details to programme division (PD) of DIPP in a compiled manner.

Jurisdictional Commissionerate of CGST shall provide necessary assistance in carrying out the inspection. Immediately after completion of inspection a copy of Inspection report would be forwarded to the Assistant/Deputy Commissioner having jurisdiction over the eligible unit.
9. Submission of application for budgetary support by the eligible unit for quarter ending September, 2017 and its sanction
(i) An eligible unit after allotment of the Unique ID may file an application for claiming budgetary support under the provisions of para 5.7 of the scheme in the format attached to this circular. The application shall be filed by the eligible unit only after return for the quarter has been filed and tax as per return is paid.

(ii) Once application is filed, duly supported by the prescribed document, the same shall be processed for sanction. The claim shall be sanctioned after verification of the tax paid by the eligible unit. The details relating to tax payment in cash and input tax credit availed, utilized including purchases made from a composition dealer during the quarter shall be available in the GST returns of the taxpayer, which are available on the CBEC GST Application for verification of the application for the budgetary support filed by the unit. The closing balance of the credit after end of the quarter shall also be provided for verification by the Assistant/Deputy Commissioner.
(iii) In cases where an entity is carrying out its operations in a State from multiple business premises, in addition to manufacture of specified goods by the eligible unit, under the same GSTIN as that of the eligible unit, the application for budgetary support shall be supported by additional information duly certified by a Chartered Accountant, relating to receipt of inputs (receipt from composition dealer to be indicated separately), input tax credit involved on the inputs or capital goods received by the eligible unit and the quantity of specified goods manufactured by the eligible unit vis-à-vis the inputs, input tax credit availed and specified goods supplied by the registrant under the given GSTIN.
In such case, on the basis of additional information and the refund application the jurisdictional Deputy Commissioner/Assistant Commissioner shall ensure that budgetary support is limited to the tax paid in cash after utilization of the input tax credit on the specified goods manufactured by the eligible unit. The return filed by the unit may be covering the entire transactions taking place outside the eligible unit in the same GSTIN.
(iv) Further, in cases where the other unit operating under same GSTIN, is supplying the inputs to the eligible unit as such or after manufacture, the credit availed by supplying unit on the inputs would have to be factored for determining the input tax credit of the eligible unit. The information in terms of para 5.9.2 of the scheme is required to be submitted by the eligible unit duly certified by a

Chartered Accountant. The jurisdictional Deputy/Assistant Commissioner in such cases shall sanction the budgetary support after reducing input tax credit relatable to inputs used by the supplying unit under same GSTIN without payment of tax as certified by a Chartered Accountant.

Subject: Online registration and online filing of the claims, by the eligible units for disbursal of budgetary support under Goods and Services Tax Regime, located in States of Jammu \& Kashmir, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and North East including Sikkim. - Regarding.

Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP), Ministry of Commerce \& Industry issued notification dated 5-10-2017 implementing "Scheme of budgetary support under Goods and Services tax Regime to the units located in States of Jammu \& Kashmir, Uttrakhand, Himachal Pradesh and North East including Sikkim." The scheme was introduced as a measure of goodwill, only to the units which were eligible for availing benefits under the earlier excise duty exemption/refund schemes but the scheme had otherwise no relation to the erstwhile schemes. The scheme of budgetary support came into operation w.e.f. 1-7-2017 for an eligible unit (as defined under para 4.1 of the scheme) and shall remain in operation for residual period (as defined in para 4.3 of the scheme) in respect of specified goods (as defined in para 4.2 of the scheme). Budgetary support under the scheme is worked out on quarterly basis and claims for the same are also filed on a quarterly basis viz. April to June, July to September, October to December and January to March. The manner and method for determination of amount of Budgetary Support, recovery procedure thereof etc. has been enumerated in the scheme.
ACES-GST portal for the scheme
2.1 In terms of para 8.1 of the scheme eligible units are required to obtain one time registration on the ACES-GST portal and obtain a unique ID which shall be used for filing application by the eligible units for reimbursement of budgetary support on the ACES-GST portal. The application filed is required to be processed and sanctioned by the Deputy Commissioner or Assistant Commissioner of the Central Tax.
2.2 In order to implement the scheme Board has issued Circular Nos. 1060/9/2017-CX, dated 27-11-2017 [2017 (356) E.L.T. (T7)] and 1061/10/2017-CX, dated 30-11-2017 [2017 (356) E.L.T. (T14)]. It was decided that units may be registered for the scheme on the basis of manual application and claim for quarter ending September, 2017 was also directed to be filed and processed manually. The same stands replicated and

accordingly registration of the units and filing of the claims up to quarter ending June, 2018 is taking place manually.
Online registration and online filing \& processing of claims
3.1 The scheme was essentially conceptualised and approved to operate in an automated environment. This would bring about better supervision, monitoring of pendency and utilisation of allocated funds and generation of reports. DG, Systems, CBIC is looking after the work relating to automation of the scheme. The development of IT System has been taken up in 3 phases namely :-
(i) Registration of the units online under the scheme;
(ii) Online filing of applications by registered units for budgetary support;
(iii) Upload of inspection report \& Integration with PFMS System for electronic disbursement of sanctioned budgetary support to the bank account of the assessees.
IT facility for Phase (i) relating to online registration and phase (ii) relating to online filing of the application including online processing and sanction by the jurisdictional Central Tax officer already stands completed. Phase (iii) which seeks to integrate the portal with PFMS is under development and likely to be ready by November, 2018. With this total automation of the scheme as per the notification would be implemented. Taxpayers are requested to ensure that they complete their processes related to phase one expeditiously as per the procedure detailed in para 4 below. Now it is proposed to implement phase (i) and (ii) without any exceptions.
3.2 It has been decided by the Board that no claim for the quarter ending September, 2018, onwards shall be allowed to be filed manually. Further, all claims after 15th October, 2018 shall be required to filed and processed in terms of para 8.1 of the scheme. In other words claims will have to be necessarily filed and processed online. After sanction of the claims online the amount sanctioned would be credited into accounts of the beneficiaries through PFMS platform as per the standard operating procedure being followed in terms of Board's circular dated 27-11-2017 \& 30-11-2017.
3.3 Further, on completion of phase 3-online linking of ACES-GST platform and PFMS platform is at advance stage of development by DG, Systems, CBIC

further procedure in this regard would be laid down by way of issuance of circular.
Online registration of existing manually registered eligible units
4. In order to rollout online filing and processing module w.e.f. 15-10-2018 online registration of the existing manually registered eligible units is a mandatory requirement. The units registered manually would be required to file fresh application for registration online on ACES-GST portal and jurisdictional Deputy Commissioner or Assistant Commissioner of Central Tax for the scheme shall approve the registration without causing any further verification and asking for additional documents and only on the basis of earlier approval of the manual registration. It must be ensured that this transition from manual registration to online registration is smooth and achieved within the time limit. Jurisdictional Commissioners of Central Tax shall monitor this transition by hand holding the eligible units so that $100 \%$ of the manually registered units existing as on 30-9-2018 are registered online by 15-10-2018 and they are in a position to file online claims on or after 15-10-2018. Unique ID generated online would be the registration no. under the scheme and relevant for online filing, processing and sanction and payment of claims. Cross referencing of manual registration with online registration is required to be maintained in the records maintained in the Division.

Subject: IGST Export Refunds - extension in SB005 alternate mechanism and revised processing in certain cases including disbursal of compensation Cess - Regarding.

CBIC has issued circulars 05/2018-Customs, dated 23-2-2018, 08/2018Customs, dated 23-3-2018 , 15/2018-Customs, dated 6-6-2018 and 40/2018Customs, dated 24-10-2018 wherein an alternative mechanism with an officer interface to resolve invoice mismatches (SB005 error) was provided for the shipping bills filed till 15-11-2018.
2. Despite wide publicity and outreach programmes to make exporters aware about the need to have identical details in invoices given in shipping Bills and GST returns, it has been observed that a few exporters continue to commit such errors. Therefore, in view of the recent announcement by Hon'ble Finance Minister, giving high priority to the interests of exporters, it has been decided by the Board to extend the rectification facility for all cases covered under Circular 40/2018-Customs, dated 24-10-2018 to Shipping Bills filed up to 31-7-2019.
3. Field formations shall conduct outreach programmes to make all stakeholders aware about the correct procedure for claiming IGST refunds so that repeated errors are avoided/minimised.
4. Difficulties, if any, shall be brought to the notice of the Board.

Subject: IGST refunds-mechanism to verify the IGST payments for goods exported out of India in certain cases - Regarding.

Kindly refer to Board's earlier Circular 12/2018-Customs, dated 29-5-2018 wherein an interim solution was provided to tide over the difficulty faced by exporters for the first 9 months after introduction of GST i.e. till 31-3-2018. Although exporters have benefited from the procedure prescribed in the said circular, and the incidence of such errors have greatly reduced, but some exporters have still committed the same error while filing GSTR-3B on account of which their records are yet to be transmitted to Customs System. CBIC has received the representations to extend the interim solution.
2. The matter has been examined. Vide Circular 12/2018-Customs, dated 29-5-2018, CBIC had provided an interim solution in cases where the records could not be transmitted from GSTN to Customs system due to payments mismatch between GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B. The solution covered the period July, 2017 to March, 2018. It appears that the payments mismatch has happened even subsequent to the period covered in the said circular. In order to overcome the problems faced by the exporters, CBIC in consultation with the GST Law Committee, has decided that the solution provided in the circular 12/2018-Customs would be applicable mutatis mutandis for the Shipping Bills filed during FY April, 2018 to March, 2019 also.
3. Therefore, in respect of guidelines provided in Para 3A and 3B of the said circular, the comparison between the cumulative IGST payments in GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B would now be for the period April, 2018 to March, 2019 and the

corresponding CA certificate evidencing that there is no discrepancy between the IGST amount refunded on exports under this circular and the actual IGST amount paid on exports of goods for the period April, 2018 to March, 2019 shall be furnished by 30th October, 2019.
4. The concerned Customs zone shall provide the list of GSTINs who have not submitted the CA certificate to the Board by the 15th November, 2019. All the field formations under your zone and the trade may be suitably sensitized in this regard.

# Clarifications regarding refunds of IGST paid on import in case of specialized agencies - M.F. (D.R.) Circular No. 23/2019-Cus., dated 1-82019

Subject: Clarifications regarding Refunds of IGST paid on import in case of specialized agencies - Regarding.

Board has received various representations wherein specialized agencies have raised the matter of refund of IGST paid on imported goods. It has been informed that the specialized agencies are paying IGST on import of goods but the refund of same is not being processed by Customs formations.
2. The matter has been deliberated among various wings of the Board like TRU, GST Policy Wing and Customs Policy Wing. It has been decided to operationalise a refund mechanism of IGST paid on imports by the specialized agencies as under :
(i) Section 55 of the CGST Act provides refund of taxes paid on the notified supplies of goods or services or both received by them. In pursuance of this provision, Notification No. 16/2017-Central Tax (Rate), dated 28-6-2017 has been issued which inter alia provides that United Nations or a specified

international organisation shall be entitled to claim refund of central tax paid on the supplies of goods or services or both received by them subject to a certificate from United Nations or that specified international organisation that the goods and services have been used or are intended to be used for official use of the United Nations or the specified international organisation. A similar refund mechanism has been provided in respect of integrated tax vide notification No. 13/2017-Central Tax (Rate) and Union Territory tax vide Notification No. 16/2017-Union Territory Tax (Rate) respectively.
(ii) Section 3(7) of Customs Tariff Act, 1975 (CTA), provides for a parity between the integrated tax rate attracted on imported goods and the integrated tax applicable on the domestic supplies of goods. In the case of UN and specialised agencies, the above referred to notifications envisage payment and then refund of taxes paid. Therefore, on this principle of parity, specialised agencies ought to get the refund of the IGST paid on imported goods.
3. In view of the above, Board has decided that respective customs field formations shall provide refund of IGST paid on import of goods by the specialized agencies notified by Central Government under Section 55 of CGST, Act, 2017.
4. Difficulties, if any, shall be brought to the knowledge of Board.

Refunds of IGST paid on import in case or risky exporters - Clarification - M.F. (D.R.) Circular No. 22/2019-Cus., dated 24-7-2019

Subject: Clarifications regarding Refunds of IGST paid on import in case of risky exporters - Regarding.

Board has received representations wherein various exporters and organisations have raised the issue of repeated opening of export containers for $100 \%$ examination related to risky exporters, under the new procedure laid down in Circular 16/2019-Cus., dated 17-6-2019. Exporters have taken the plea that their cargo is getting delayed and they have to incur additional costs for carrying out re-packing.
2. The matter has been examined. Board has issued the aforesaid circular as a preventive measure against fraudulent refund of IGST on the basis of ineligible or fraudulently availed input tax credit (ITC). While addressing the aforesaid issue and consequent risk to revenue, Board would not like to dilute the emphasis it laid on reduction in time and cost related with EXIM clearances. It is pertinent to mention that only a miniscule percentage of export consignments are being selected for examination on account of risk associated with fraudulent availment of IGST refunds. However, keeping in view the issues raised by trade, Board has decided that the requirement of $100 \%$ physical examination of each export consignment shall be gradually relaxed provided no irregularity was noticed in earlier examinations of export consignments of export entities in terms of Circular No. 16/2019-Cus., dated 17-6-2019.
3. In order to bring down the level of examination, Board has decided that RMCC shall take into consideration the feedback received from field formations with regard to the $100 \%$ examination conducted on exports of risk based identified entities and wherever the examination has validated the declaration made in the shipping bill, RMCC may review the risk assessment and gradually taper down the percentage of physical examination. Suitable alerts based on re-evaluated risk may accordingly be inserted in the system by RMCC in such cases.
4. Difficulties, if any, shall be brought to the notice of the Board.

Subject: IGST refunds-mechanism to verify the IGST payments for goods exported out of India in certain cases - Regarding.

The procedure for claiming IGST refunds is fully automated as provided under Instruction 15/2017-Cus., dated 9-10-2017. It has come to the notice of the Board that instances of availment of IGST refund using fraudulent ITC claims by some exporters have been observed by various authorities. Exporters have availed ITC on the basis of ineligible documents or fraudulently and utilized that credit for payment of IGST on goods exported out of India. It has also been observed in several cases that there is huge variation between the FOB value declared in the Shipping Bill and the Taxable value declared in GST Return apparently to effect higher IGST pay out leading to encashment of credit.
2. In view of above, it has been decided to verify the IGST payments through the respective GST field formations. The procedure specified in the instruction 15/2017-Cus., dated 9-10-2017 stand modified to the extent as under:
A. Identification of Suspicious cases: DG (Systems) shall work out the suitable criteria to identify risky exporters at the national level and forward the list of said risky exporters to Risk Management Centre for Customs (RMCC) and respective Chief Commissioners of Central Tax. DG (Systems) shall inform the respective Chief Commissioner of Central Tax about the past IGST refunds granted to such risky exporters (along with details of bank accounts in which such refund has been disbursed).
B. Inserting Alert in the System : RMCC shall insert alerts for all such risky exporters and make $100 \%$ examination mandatory of export consignments relating to those risky exporters. Also, alert shall be placed to suspend IGST refunds in such cases.
C. Examination of the export goods : Customs officers shall examine the consignment as per the RMCC alert. In case the outcome of examination tallies

with the declaration in the Shipping Bill subject to no other violation of any of provision of the Customs Act, 1962 or other laws being observed, the consignment may be cleared as per the regular practice.
D. Suspension of IGST refunds : Notwithstanding the clearance of the export consignments as per para C above, such Shipping Bills shall be suspended for IGST refund by the Deputy or Assistant Commissioner of Customs dealing with refund at the port of export.
E. Verification by GST formations :
(i) Chief Commissioner of Central Tax shall get the verification of the IGST refund claims and other related aspects done in accordance with the Standard Operating procedure to be issued by the GST policy wing.
(ii) The GST formation shall furnish a report to the respective Chief Commissioner of Central Tax within 30 days specifying clearly whether the amount of IGST paid and claimed/sanctioned as refund was in accordance with the law or not.
(iii) Chief Commissioner of Central Tax shall compile and forward report of all cases to RMCC and concerned customs port of export within 5 working days thereafter.
F. Action to be taken by customs formations on receipt of verification report from GST formations :
(i) Cases where no malpractices have been reported on verification : On receipt of verification report from Chief Commissioner of Central Tax informing that the ITC availed by the exporter was in accordance with the GST Law and rules made thereunder, the Customs officer at the port of export shall proceed to process the IGST refund to the extent verified by the GST Authorities. The detailed advisory in this regard shall be issued by DG (Systems) for the benefit of customs officers handling refunds.
(ii) Cases where malpractices have been reported on verification : For cases where upon verification, it has been found that the exporter has availed ITC fraudulently or on the basis of ineligible documents and utilized the said ITC for payment of IGST claimed as refund, the customs officer will not process the refund claim.
3. Difficulties in this regard may be brought to the knowledge of the Board.

Refunds - IGST Export Refunds - Resolution of Errors - M.F. (D.R.) Circular No. 1/2019-Cus., dated 2-1-2019
F. No. 450/119/2017-Cus. IV

Government of India
Ministry of Finance (Department of Revenue)
Central Board of Indirect Taxes \& Customs, New Delhi

Subject: IGST Export Refunds-resolution of errors - Regarding.

The processing of IGST refund claims on exports is fully automated. Majority of refunds claims are getting processed and sanctioned within five days of filing of GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B returns. However, in a few cases, particularly for the LCL cargo consignments originating from ICDs, Export General Manifest (EGM) related errors continue to hinder smooth and automatic sanction of IGST refund claims. The nature of these errors has been examined in detail. It has been observed that the main reasons for such EGM errors still hampering the IGST refund processing are as under :
(i) Online filing of both local and Gateway EGM not being done on time by the concerned stakeholders.
(ii) Mismatch in local and gateway EGM details wherever both are filed online.
(iii) Non-filing of stuffing report by the Preventive officers at Gateway Ports for the LCL cargo being consolidated at the Gateway Ports/CFSs in the system.
2. Non-filing/Late filing of Online Local and Gateway EGM :-
(i) The processing of IGST refund gets hampered either because the local EGM has not been filed online or has been filed late. There are instances where the cargo originating from the hinterland ICDs reached the gateway port without the local EGM having been filed online. Earlier vide Circular No. 42/2017-Cus., dated 7-11-2017 it was explained that due to manual filing of EGM in respect of Shipping bills originating from ICDs, system is unable to match the gateway EGM and the local EGM. Therefore, it was instructed that all the custodians/carriers/ shipping lines operating at ICDs/Gateway ports

should file EGM online. It is re-iterated that the first step would be that the concerned stakeholders at the originating ICDs file the local EGMs online.
(ii) Where the export goods are directly moved by truck to the gateway port, in such cases, filing the local EGM timely should not pose any problem. At inland ICDs/CFSs connected by train, the local EGM shall be filed before the goods actually move out of ICD/CFS. In ICDs/CFSs not connected by train but where the movement of export goods begins from the nearest train-based ICD/CFS, it has been observed that local EGM is not being filed as the Train Number is not known to the custodian for the want of Rail receipt. In such cases, it must be ensured that local EGM is filed by the custodian immediately after getting Train details in which containers are moving to Gateway port but in any case, before the train leaves for the Gateway port. Officers at these stations shall constantly monitor to check the pendency and take necessary action.
(iii) Non-filing of EGM clearly hints at non-compliance by the custodian/ person in charge of the conveyance carrying export goods. Section 41 of the Customs Act authorizes the customs officer to take action against such nonfilers. However, more than invoking the penal sections, jurisdictional Commissioners need to constantly monitor the activity of timely filing of the EGM and take necessary steps to ensure the same.
(iv) Board expects its jurisdictional officers to take all necessary steps to ensure that all EGMs of cargo related to past cases are filed before 31st January, 2019. As a measure of facilitation, penal provisions may not be invoked for EGMs filed till 31st January, 2019. However, continued noncompliance beyond 1st February, 2019 may be dealt strictly by taking recourse to penal provisions in accordance with the law.
3. Mismatch in Local EGM and Gateway EGM :
(i) The errors arising out of mismatch of information provided in local and Gateway EGM has been discussed in para 6 of Circular No. 06/2018-Customs where in Board had clearly delineated the roles and responsibilities of the Customs officers at the inland ICDs/CFSs and at the Gateway port or CFSs attached with the gateway ports respectively in so far as the task of integrating the local EGM and the gateway EGM was concerned.

(ii) One of the major hindrances in smooth processing of IGST refunds for the past period is the problem faced by field formations in gathering information with regard to LCL cargo from Shipping lines and Custodians. The matter has been examined. The procedure related to consolidation of cargo at Gateway ports has already been prescribed vide Circular No. 55/2000-Cus., dated 30-6-2000 wherein it is provided inter alia that the custodian of the gateway port or CFS near gateway port is required to maintain a tally sheet container-wise, giving details of the export consignments, the previous Container No., Shipping Bill No., AR-4 No. and the details of new container in which goods have been re-stuffed. It was also mandated that the concerned shipping line would issue the Bill of Lading, a copy of which would be handed over to the custodian. After necessary endorsements regarding inspection, the other transference copy would be returned to the originating ICD/CFS. Thus, the custodian of the CFSs or Gateway port bears the responsibility to maintain all records with regard to LCL cargo consolidated at their premises. Subsequently, vide circular No. 8/2018-Customs, instead of the said transference copy, correlation with final bill of lading or written confirmation from the custodian of the gateway CFS was permitted for purposes of integration of the local and gateway EGM.
(iii) It has also been learnt that in some field formations tally sheet is being maintained in the form of Container Load Plan (CLP) which is prepared by Shipping lines and gives details of packages stuffed in the container. It has been reported that cargo is de-stuffed under customs supervision based on Container De-stuffing Plan (CDP). Preparing CLP/CDP does not absolve the custodian of the responsibility of keeping account of the cargo being handled in the form of a tally sheet. Such local practice of CLP/CDP appears to have been started only for the convenience of shipping lines/custodian. The accounting of previous containers vis-a-vis new container in case of LCL cargo being re-stuffed at CFS or Gateway port is an important event in establishing the linkage between the local EGM and Gateway EGM. Circular 55/2000-Cus., dated 30-6-2000 mandating the procedure to be followed at Gateway Ports or CFS attached to Gateway ports and the originating inland ICDs/CFSs for consolidation of LCL cargo on Gateway ports or CFS attached to such gateway ports is still in vogue and the same has not been dispensed with.

(iv) Agents of Shipping lines/freight forwarders/consolidators operating at the inland ICDs/CFSs play a very critical role in booking of the export cargo for the overseas destination. CBIC has deputed its officers to some of the inland ICDs/CFSs. The feedback obtained has revealed that these entities have all the necessary information regarding the movement of goods from ICDs/CFSs to Gateway port, consolidation at the gateway port and journey beyond. These entities can be easily approached to provide the requisite information/ documents for rectification of EGM related errors in case exporters for some reason do not have the requisite information. Jurisdictional Customs officers at inland ICDs/CFSs are therefore, required to approach these agents to obtain the details of re-worked containers ( C or N related EGM errors). The information gathered from the agents shall be collated and immediately communicated to Gateway port officers so that rectification of errors ( C or N ) could be done.
(v) Customs officers in charge of CFSs shall provide list of Shipping Bills having SB006 error i.e. EGM errors to the concerned CFSs at gateway ports. The custodians shall in turn provide details as mentioned in Tally Sheets or CDP/CLP (containing container details) relating to the said SBs to the Customs officers. Simultaneously, Gateway port officers shall coordinate with the officers of the originating ICDs/CFSs to obtain relevant particulars in accordance with the procedure in para (iv) above. It shall be the responsibility of the officers in charge of CFSs at Gateway ports to obtain necessary details from the stakeholders which establish the linkages between the goods received from inland ICDs/CFSs and those exported out of India except in cases where the local EGM has not been filed in which case the responsibility would be of the officers manning the inland ICD/CFS.
(vi) Once the details are received, the Preventive officer/P.O. at the gateway port CFSs shall use the option in the Preventive Officer role (PREV_OFF) to rectify container details. (Refer ICES Advisory 8/18, dated 9-3-2018). The preventive officer can amend the container details in the Gateway EGM CTR Amendment Option to correct the N and C errors after verifying the relevant details from shipping bill, master BL and House (local) BL. Once the corrections are made, EGM officer at Gateway port can revalidate EGMs for successful integration of the updated details. For those shipping bills in

respect of which no gateway EGM was filed in the first place, the shipping line can file supplementary EGM for successful integration.
(vii) Responsibilities and liabilities of custodians have been provided in detail in the Handling of Cargo in Customs Areas Regulations, 2009. Regulation 6 clearly casts the responsibility of keeping account of export goods on the Customs Cargo Service Provider (CCSP). Further, the procedure for suspension or revocation and imposition of penalty is provided in Regulation 12 which can be resorted to in cases where CCSP fails to comply with the regulations. This must be strictly enforced after following due process in instances of persistent non-compliance.
(viii) Export of goods out of India is an essential condition for grant of IGST refund as provided in Rule 96 of CGST Rules, 2017. It therefore warrants verification whether the goods were indeed exported out of India where the IGST refund claims have been long pending with EGM error (SB006).
4. Stuffing Report by Preventive Officers at Gateway Ports
(i) It appears that in some gateway ports, the Preventive officers are entering stuffing report in ICES application of Customs EDI System pertaining to the shipping bills filed only in gateway port, but not for the shipping bills which have been filed in ICDs. It is important that Preventive officers posted in gateway ports should enter stuffing reports for all shipping bills irrespective of the fact from where they have been filed i.e. in gateway port or ICDs.
(ii) Further, in order to avoid the problem of mismatch in information in local and gateway EGMs, the preventive officers must play a proactive role. Custodian at CFSs/Gateway Ports shall prepare Tally Sheet as mandated in Circular No. 55/2000-Cus. The preventive officer shall supervise de-stuffing and re-stuffing, so as to verify the details like number of package(s), quantity etc. and satisfy himself that there is no short shipment, replacement or diversion of cargo etc. In addition to providing the stuffing report for the local cargo, the gateway port officer should also verify the correctness of package(s) and container details for cargo coming from inland ICDs cargo immediately in ICES, using the Gateway EGM CTR Amendment option. Tally sheet shall be prepared containing all the necessary details simultaneously. Corrections, if required, in the container/ package details shall be rectified at

this stage itself to avoid the occurrence of N and C errors, when the gateway EGM is eventually filed. Once the corrections are made, the EGM officer at the Gateway port can revalidate EGMs for successful integration of the updated details.
5. Board had vide Circular No. 67/2000-Customs extended the procedure prescribed in 55/2000-Customs to agents of shipping lines/MTOs/NVOCCS/freight forwarders/consolidators. This was purely a facilitation measure taking into account the business practice of the shipping lines. Board has allowed these entities a role in the logistics chain only to facilitate the trade. Since these entities have the necessary information, it should not be difficult for them to provide the particulars required to resolve the pending SB006 cases. Therefore, there is a responsibility on these entities to coordinate with the field formations in return. Board would be constrained to review the facility given vide 67/2000-Customs to agents of shipping lines/ MTOs/NVOCCS/freight forwarders/consolidators should there be any report of non-cooperation and non-compliance from their side.
6. Chief Commissioners are requested to strictly implement the guidelines given above. Difficulties, if any, should be brought to the notice of the Board. Hindi version follows.

Subject: IGST Export Refunds - extension in SB005 alternate mechanism and revised processing in certain cases including disbursal of compensation Cess - Regarding.

Exporters are availing the refunds of IGST paid on exports regularly for more than a year now. It has been observed that exporters have committed many errors which have hampered sanctioning of IGST refund. CBIC has introduced several options and alternative mechanisms through which various mismatch errors between the Shipping Bill (SB) and GSTR-1 data can be handled in the system.
2. CBIC has issued circulars 05/2018-Customs, dated 23-2-2018, 08/2018Customs, dated 23-3-2018, 15/2018-Customs, dated 6-6-2018 and 22/2018Customs, dated 18-7-2018 respectively wherein an alternative mechanism with an officer interface to resolve invoice mismatches (SB 005 error) was provided for the shipping bills filed till 30-6-2018. Although the cases having SB005 error have gone down, but still representations have been received from exporters/associations that some exporters had, due to lack of familiarity/awareness, committed the same mistake due to which their IGST refunds are stuck and requested for extension of date. Issue has been examined and it has been observed that exporters are committing same mistakes again and again in spite of several sensitisation/outreach programmes. However, giving high priority to the interests of exporters, it has been decided by the Board to extend the rectification facility to Shipping Bills filed up to 15-11-2018. However, it has been reiterated that the exporters shall have to take care to ensure the details of invoice, such as invoice number, IGST paid etc. under GSTR-1 and shipping bill match with each other since the same transaction is being reported under GST laws and Customs Act.
3. It may be noted that SBs which have not been scrolled due to the IGST paid amount erroneously declared as 'NA' are already being handled through officer interface as per Board's Circular 08/2018-Customs, dated 23-3-2018. However, no such provision was hitherto available in respect of those SBs which were successfully scrolled, albeit with a lesser than eligible amount.
4. CBIC has been receiving representations where the refund scroll has been generated for a much lesser IGST amount than what has actually been paid against the exported goods. Broadly, this has happened due to :
a. Error made by the Exporter/CHA in declaring the IGST paid amount in SB or,

b. Cases where Compensation Cess paid amount was not entered by the Exporter in the SB along with the IGST paid amount or the same details were not transmitted by GSTN, and the scroll consequently got generated only for the IGST amount or,
c. Typographical mistake by the customs officer while sanctioning the refund through officer interface.
5. In a bid to provide relief to exporters in respect of categories indicated at Para 4 above, Directorate of Systems has now provided a facility in ICES for the processing and sanctioning of the eligible differential IGST refund. The facility would be officer interface based and is similar to the procedure for processing certain SB005 refund claims refer Circular No. 05/2018-Customs, dated 23-2-2018. This facility would be available only for cases where Shipping Bills have been filed till 15-11-2018. However, exporters need to be cautious while filing details in Shipping Bill as a similar facility may not be available in future for the same mistake for referred shipping bill. Also, Customs Officers while processing claims using officer interface should exercise due diligence so that mistakes are not repeated again.
6. In order to claim the differential amount, the exporter is required to submit a duly filled and signed Revised Refund Request (RRR) annexed to this circular to the designated AC/DC. A scanned copy of the RRR may also be mailed to dedicated email address of Customs locations from where exports took place. The designated/concerned AC/DC will then proceed to sanction the revised amount after due verification through the option provided in ICES, a detailed advisory on which will be communicated by DG Systems to all the System Mangers shortly. Once the revised amount is approved by the designated AC/DC in the system, a fresh scroll will be available for generation for the differential amount only.
7. It may be noted that only those SBs which have already been scrolled shall be available in this facility. Further, this facility can be used only once for each eligible SB to sanction the revised IGST amount. Thus, utmost care may be taken by the exporter while submitting the RRR as well as the sanctioning officer while sanctioning the revised amount as no further provision will be available for revising the refund sanction again.

8. With this facility, it is hoped that the eligible exporters will come forward for rectification of the mistakes to enable sanction of balance refund amount. Field formations are accordingly requested to give wide publicity to this circular including public notice, publication in local dailies, Customs house website, social media etc. and sensitize the trade and organised outreach programmes with major export associations/stakeholders within the stipulated time i.e. 15-11-2018. Customs officers under your charge dealing with IGST refund may also be given suitable instructions to proactively and expeditiously process the revised refund requests.

IGST Refunds - Cases where IGST refunds have not been granted due to claiming higher rate of drawback or where higher rate and lower rate were identical - C.B.I. \& C. Circular No. 37/2018-Cus., dated 9-10-2018
F. No. 450/119/2017-Cus. IV

Subject: Cases where IGST refunds have not been granted due to claiming higher rate of drawback OR where higher rate and lower rate were identical Regarding.

Numerous representations have been received from exporters/export associations, regarding cases where IGST refunds have not been granted because higher rate of drawback has been claimed or where higher rate and lower rate were identical.
2.0 The issue has been examined extensively in this Ministry. The legal provisions related to Drawback claims are as under:
2.1 Notes and condition (11) of Notf. No. 131/2016-Cus. (N.T.), dated 31-102016 (as amended by Notf. No. 59/2017-Cus. (N.T.), dated 29-6-2017), under which All Industry Rates of Drawback had been notified and which were applicable for availing composite rates during period in question (i.e. 1-72017 to 30-9-2017), prescribed that 'The rates and caps of drawback specified in columns (4) and (5) of the said Schedule shall not be applicable to export of a commodity or product if such commodity or product is -
...
(d) exported claiming refund of the integrated goods and services tax paid on such exports'.
2.2 Notes and Condition (12A) of Notfn. No. 131/2016-Cus. (N.T.), dated 31-10-2016 (as amended by Notfn. No. 59/2017-Cus. (N.T.), dated 29-6-2017 and 73/2017-Cus. (N.T.) dated 26-7-2017) prescribed that 'The rates and caps of drawback specified in columns (4) and (5) of the said Schedule shall be applicable to export of a commodity or product if the exporter satisfies the following conditions, namely :-
... ... ...
(ii) If the goods are exported on payment of integrated goods and services tax, the exporter shall declare that no refund of integrated goods and services tax paid on export product shall be claimed;
2.3 In terms of Rules 12 and 13 of the Customs, Central Excise Duties and Service Tax Drawback Rules, 1995, the shipping bill itself is treated as claim for drawback in terms of the declarations made on the shipping bill.

2.4 The declarations required in terms of above Notes and Conditions and provisions of the Drawback Rules are made electronically in the EDI System. When composite drawback rate was claimed (by declaring suffix A or C with Drawback serial number), exporter was required to tick DBK002 and DBK003 declarations in the shipping bills. In fact, for period 1-7-2017 to 26-7-2017, a manual declaration was also required to be given as the changes made on 26-7-2017 were made applicable for exports made from 1-7-2017 onwards.
2.5 By declaring drawback serial number suffixed with A or C and by making above stated declarations, the exporters consciously relinquished their IGST/ITC claims.
3. It has been noted that exporters had availed the option to take drawback at higher rate in place of IGST refund out of their own volition. Considering the fact that exporters have made aforesaid declaration while claiming the higher rate of drawback, it has been decided that it would not be justified allowing exporters to avail IGST refund after initially claiming the benefit of higher drawback. There is no justification for re-opening the issue at this stage.
4. Field formations may, therefore, take necessary steps to bring these changes to the knowledge of exporters.
5. Difficulties, if any, may be brought to the notice of the Board. Hindi version will follow.

IGST Refund - Sanction of pending IGST refund claims where the records have not been transmitted from the GSTN to DG Systems - M.F. (D.R.) Circular No. 33/2018-Cus., dated 19-9-2018

Subject: Sanction of pending IGST refund claims where the records have not been transmitted from the GSTN to DG Systems - Regarding.

It may be recalled that vide Circular 12/2018-Customs, dated 29-5-2018, Board had provided interim solution to the problem faced by the exporters whose records were not transmitted from GSTN to Customs due to mismatch in GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B. The interim solution was subject to undertakings/submission of CA certificates by the exporters as given in Circular 12/2018-Customs and post-refund audit scrutiny.
2. Representation has been received from the Cost Accountant Association for authorizing them also to give certificates to the exporters on said subject. The matter has been examined in the Board and it has been observed that under CGST Act, 2017, Cost Accountants have also been recognized for various certifications/representations like in Section 35, Section 66, Section 116 and Section 48 read with Rule 24 of Return rules.
3. Hence, it has been decided that Cost Accountants are also authorized to provide the requisite certificates as envisaged under Circular 12/2018Customs, dated 29-5-2018.
4. Field formations may, therefore, take necessary steps to bring these changes to the knowledge of exporters.
5. Difficulties, if any, may be brought to the notice of the Board. Hindi version will follow.

IGST - Refund of IGST on export of goods on payment of duty - SB003 errors and extension of date in SB005 \& other cases using officer interface for rectification of errors - Clarification - M.F. (D.R.) Circular No. 22/2018-Cus., dated 18-7-2018

Subject: Refund of IGST on export of goods on payment of duty Clarification in case of SB003 errors and extension of date in SB005 \& other cases using officer Interface for rectification of errors - Regarding.

It may be recalled that in circular 15/2018-Customs, dated 6-6-2018, CBIC has provided for the resolution of SB003 error in certain cases through the utility developed by the Directorate of Systems in a similar manner as SB005 error. It has been brought to the knowledge of the Board that in several cases, the exporters have mentioned PAN instead of GSTIN in the Shipping Bills, even though GSTIN has been correctly mentioned while filing the GST returns. Due to this mismatch, the IGST refund claims are not getting processed.
2. The matter has been examined. As PAN is embedded in the GSTIN, CBIC has decided to accord similar treatment to such cases also as are already covered under Para 2 of Circular 15/2018-Customs. The conditions prescribed in para 2 of the said circular shall apply mutatis mutandis.
3. CBIC has issued circulars 5/2018-Customs, dated 23-2-2018, 8/2018Customs, dated 23-3-2018 and 15/2018-Customs, dated 6-6-2018 wherein an alternative mechanism with an officer interface to resolve invoice mismatches (SB005 error) was provided for the shipping bills filed till 30-4-2018. Despite wide publicity and outreach programmes to make exporters aware about the need to have identical details in invoices given in shipping Bills and GST returns, it has been observed that a few exporters continue to commit such errors. Therefore, in view of the ongoing Refund Fortnight, giving high priority to the interests of exporters, it has been decided by the Board to extend the rectification facility to Shipping Bills filed up to 30-6-2018.
4. Further, the facility of rectification through Officer Interface is also extended in case of other errors mentioned in circulars (8/2018-Customs and 15/2018-Customs) for shipping bills filed up to 30-6-2018. However, at the same time, exporters are advised to henceforth ensure due diligence and discipline to avoid such mismatch errors as such extensions are not likely to be considered in future.
5. Field formations may, therefore, take necessary steps to bring these changes to the knowledge of exporters.
6. Difficulties, if any, may be brought to the notice of the Board. Hindi version follows.

IGST - Setting up of Help Desks for refund of IGST on export of goods on payment of duty - M.F. (D.R.) Circular No. 21/2018-Cus., dated 18-7-2018

Subject: Refund of IGST on export of Goods on payment of duty - Setting up of Help Desks - Regarding.

Various representations have been received in the Board wherein micro, small and medium enterprise exporters have informed that their IGST refunds are held up and that they are unable to approach Customs port of exports due to factors like distance, lack of information/knowledge etc. As part of the ongoing Refund Fortnight, it has been decided to set up Help Desks at the offices of FIEO and AEPC for expeditious resolution of IGST refund related issues.
2. The Help Desks would be located at the locations mentioned in Annexure A, and would function for a period of 2 weeks till 1st August, 2018. They will be manned by officers of Customs, who shall be nominated by the jurisdictional Customs zone. The necessary infrastructure like Computer, Scanner/Printer, Internet, Cabin Space etc. would be made available to the officers by FIEO/AEPC.
3. The Directorate of Systems shall provide the status of each pending IGST refund claim with specific error due to which it is being held up, on Antarang. The icegate e-mail ID of the officer(s) deputed at the Help Desk may immediately be informed to Team.ICES@icegate.gov.in to enable access to the data. The officers deputed at Help Desks would use this data to inform the exporters about the documents required, if any, and guide them to resolve the errors. The exporters can provide details related to any port of export at the Help Desk near their location. The Help Desk shall act as an extended office of

the Port of export and collect documents/information on behalf of the port of export. The details provided by the exporters to the Help Desk shall be transmitted by ICEGATE e-mail to the nodal officers at the port of export. The ICEGATE e-mail ID of the nodal officer of each port of export shall immediately be informed to Team.ICES@icegate.gov.in. The Customs officers at the port of export shall process the refund claim after all the necessary details/documents submitted at the Help Desks have been forwarded to the nodal officer at the port of export. There shall be no need for the exporters to visit any port of export once all the requisite documents/information have been submitted at the Help Desks.
4. Field formations may, therefore, take necessary steps to bring these changes to the knowledge of exporters.

Central Board of Indirect Taxes \& Customs, New Delhi

Subject: Refund of IGST paid on exports of goods done from Non-EDI sites - Regarding.

The procedure for refund of IGST paid on export of goods under Rule 96 of CGST Rules, 2017 was provided vide instruction 15/2017-Customs, dated 9-10-2017 for all EDI locations. The facility to disburse IGST refund of goods exported from Non-EDI locations has been provided by DG (Systems). Already it has been informed that IGST Refunds for exports made from Non-EDI sites are being disbursed regularly through the EDI System.
2. For the convenience of the field formations, the procedure for processing IGST refund claims for exports made from Non-EDI sites, is as under :
(i) Firstly, the export data is to be captured using offline utilities and transmitted by the field formations to DG (Systems) by email.
(ii) The data is then uploaded for verification and final submission by the Customs officer in ICES at the nearest EDI site.
(iii) The refund scroll is then generated for the verified SBs after these are matched with the GST Returns data received from GSTN;
(iv) Detailed advisories have been issued from time to time on these steps. Further, a public enquiry has been made available on ICEGATE website for checking the details and IGST status of manual SBs verified in ICES.

(v) Specific IGST related errors or mismatches can also be checked by an importer/Customs Broker for his SBs using his ICEGATE login.
(vi) It is only when a SB is verified by the Customs officer in ICES does it become ready for the IGST validation procedure.
(vii) Data has been uploaded in ICES for verification of exports made upto March, 2018. However, some sites have not yet sent the data by email for some months and ADG (ICES) has reminded the respective Commissioners vide letter dated 8-10-2018.
(viii) In other cases where the data is available in ICES, the verification process is in progress.
3. It is, therefore, requested that in order to speed up the refunds, field formations may be suitably instructed to upload the balance data and also complete the verification process on priority.
4. Any difficulties faced by field formations pertaining to above issue may kindly be referred to the Board.

GST - Refund of IGST on export of Goods - Extension of date in SB005 alternate mechanism cases and Clarification in other cases - Circular No. 15/2018-Cus., dated 6-6-2018

Government of India

Subject: Refund of IGST on export of Goods - Extension of date in SB005 alternate mechanism cases and Clarification in other cases - Regarding.

CBIC has issued Circular Nos. 05/2018-Customs, dated 23-2-2018 [2018 (10) G.S.T.L. C3] and 08/2018-Customs, dated 23-3-2018 wherein an alternative mechanism with officer interface to resolve invoice mismatches was provided for the shipping bills filed till 28-2-2018. Although the cases having SB005 error have now ebbed due to continuous outreach done by the Board and

increased awareness amongst the trade, however, some exporters nevertheless, continue to make errors in filing invoice details in the shipping bill and the GST returns. Therefore, keeping in view the difficulties faced by the exporters in respect of SB005 errors, Board has decided to extend the facility of officer interface to Shipping bills filed up to 30-4-2018. However, the exporters are advised to align their export invoices submitted to Customs and GST authorities for smooth processing of refund claims.
2. Apart from SB005 errors, IGST refunds are also stuck on account of SB003 error on the customs side. This error occurs when there is a mismatch between GSTIN entity mentioned in the Shipping bill and the one filing GSTR-1/GSTR-3B. Board has examined the issue and it has been decided to provide a correction facility in cases where although GSTIN of both the entities are different but PAN is same. This happens mostly in cases where an entity filing Shipping bill is a registered office and the entity which has paid the IGST is manufacturing unit/other office or vice versa. However, in all such cases, entity claiming refund (one which has filed the Shipping bill) will give an undertaking to the effect that its other office (one which has paid IGST) shall not claim any refund or any benefit of the amount of IGST so paid. The undertaking shall be signed by authorized persons of both the entities. This undertaking has to be submitted to the Customs officer at the port of export. CBIC had some time back requested Directorate of Systems to develop a correction tool, online of one developed for SB005, for sanction of refund in cases where PAN provided in Shipping Bill is same as PAN of GSTR 1. DG Systems have developed this utility now which would facilitate processing of IGST refund claims stuck due to SB003 error in the manner similar to SB005 error.
3. Field formations may, therefore, take necessary steps to bring these changes to the knowledge of exporters.
4. Difficulties, if any, may be brought to the notice of the Board. Hindi version follows.

E-commerce exports through Post and clarification on personal imports - Procedure - Circular No. 14/2018-Cus., dated 4-6-2018

F. No. 476/02/2016-LC

Government of India
Ministry of Finance (Department of Revenue)
Central Board of Indirect Taxes \& Customs, New Delhi

Subject: Procedure for e-commerce exports through Post and clarification on personal imports - Regarding.

In order to facilitate exports and specifically give a fillip to the global outreach of India's exporters via e-commerce (more so to the small \& medium enterprises), all IEC holders have been permitted to export goods through FPOs. Any IEC holder exporting goods through the FPO, will be eligible for zero rating of exports, by way of IGST refund or discharge of LUT. Those who do not wish to avail this facility or fall in the category of Exempted/NonTaxable are also permitted to export under the same procedure. In order to cater to e-commerce exports through post, the Board has prescribed the declaration forms under "Exports by Post Regulations, 2018".
2. In absence of EDI system at FPOs, the Postal Bill of Export (PBE-I) for ecommerce exports will be processed in manual environment for the time being. However, for the purpose of GST, data will be captured and uploaded through an off-line utility (ICAN) provided by DG (Systems). It is clarified that till such time that computers with ICAN facility are installed and operationalised, exporters will be free to follow the procedure contained herein.
3. Vide circular 36/2016-Customs dated 29th July 2016, the Board had in pursuance to para 9.17A of the Foreign Trade Policy 2015-20, prescribed a procedure for e-commerce exports under MEIS. Presently, the facility extends to the Foreign Post Offices at Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai. Exports under MEIS through Post will continue to be governed through the aforesaid circular, except that the declaration form appended to thereto shall now be replaced with PBE-1, which has been prescribed under the new Regulations. It is further provided that exports under e-commerce, not involving MEIS, may be done through any notified Foreign Post Office under the following procedure:

4. Any exporter holding a valid Import-Export Code shall be permitted to export goods by filing a Postal Bill of Export (PBE) in the form prescribed under the "Export by Post Regulations 2018".
4.1 Every PBE-I (for e-commerce exports) shall be filed in duplicate and shall cover only one consignor, though it can be used for any number of consignees. In other words, there will be no limit on the number of postal shipments which can be effected using a single Postal Bill of Export-I. The exporter shall be required to attach the invoice(s) with the PBE. In addition, the exporter shall continue filing of the postal label or declaration as per CN 22/CN 23 (Forms attached). An important ingredient of the revised CN 22/CN 23 forms is that a column for "sale of goods" has been added.
4.2 The PBE along with goods shall be presented to the Customs at the Foreign Post Office. In case of constraints of space or other logistics issues, the jurisdictional commissioner in consultation with the jurisdictional PMG, may also notify any other designated Post Office for presentation of export goods, through a public notice. The PBE shall be processed manually. Upon completion of processing of the PBE by Customs, the goods shall be presented to the Postal department, who will acknowledge receipt of the shipment on the PBE and affix the tracking number of each shipment on the same. Upon affixation of the tracking number by postal authorities, the PBE shall be brought back to the Proper Officer for grant of "Let Export Order". The original PBE will be retained by Customs and the duplicate PBE will be handed over to the exporter or his customs broker.
4.3 In the case of exports, not involving e-commerce, the PBE-II shall be filed in duplicate and shall cover only one consignor and one consignee though multiple packages between a given consignor and a given consignee can be covered in the same PBE. The procedure as above will be followed.
4.4 Commissionerates are advised to make suitable arrangements for noting and processing of PBEs. All extant instructions relating to examination \& assessment applicable to shipping bills will continue to apply. Chief Commissioners/Commissioners are requested to evolve guidance for officers for manual risk management.

4.5 The Postal Authorities will furnish the proof of export of the goods i.e. copy of relevant CN/CP forms, as applicable to different categories of postal mails, to the Customs at the FPO. Essentially, the document must contain the tracking nos. of the parcel along with dispatch identifier. A corresponding entry relating to proof of export will be made in noting register. Only after receipt of such proof of export should details in ICAN be uploaded.
5. During the course of deliberations in the Customs \& India Post Joint Conference on facilitating exports through e-commerce (held on 11th May 2018), the issue of off-line data entry, increase in exports through post and ensuing shortage of staff was discussed. Ways \& means were discussed for providing best possible convenience to exporters w.r.t. logistics requirements of a small parcel environment alongside of following manual customs procedures. After due consideration of the deliberations, the Board has permitted Customs Brokers (CBs) to operate at all FPOs for the ease of operations of exporters. It is also decided that in order to ensure transparency and visibility, CBs will be required to onboard any third-party web-application before commencing operations at the FPO.
5.1 The web-application shall have the following functionalities:
(a) The IEC holders and Customs brokers using FPOs for exports should be registered on the application with KYC documents;
(b) The e-commerce exporter would input data required in the PBE (with multiple consignees) on the web-application;
(c) The application shall provide the facility of printing the Postal Bill of Export (PBE-1) from the web-application, and the Customs Broker shall file the same at the FPO as per manual procedure;
(d) The web-application shall also provide the facility of uploading postal tracking numbers by the Customs Brokers;
(e) The application should provide dashboards to the exporters and customs brokers w.r.t to their shipments;

(f) Customs at the FPO shall have log in facility to view data with respect to a FPO or a Customs Broker or any exporter for the purpose of data analysis and profiling for risk management; and
(g) The application will provide the facility to customs officer to verify the data and download into a locally installed PC;
5.2 It is clarified that Customs will not be on boarding the web-application for conducting any regulatory process. All customs procedures will remain in manual mode, till introduction of EDI at FPOs. The application will be essentially used between the exporter and customs broker to facilitate communication, enable shipment visibility and printing of PBE or any such other value-added services for B2B use.
6. In the case of natural persons (i.e. other than firms \& companies) exporting parcels, there is no change in procedure being followed hitherto. It is clarified that they will not be required to file any PBE.
6.1 In the case of export of jewellery as provided under para 4.48 of the FTP (2015-20), as amended upto 5-12-2017, extant procedures shall continue to be followed.
7. In the budget of 2017, chapter heading 9804 was amended to cover all types of personal imports, whether by post, courier, air or sea. Note 4 to chapter 98 was also amended to exclude from heading 9804, motor vehicles, alcoholic beverages and tobacco products.
8. Also, the Foreign Trade Amendment Order, 2017 dated 25-7-2017 has amended clause 3(1)(i) of the Foreign Trade (Exemption from application of rules in certain cases) Order, 1993, and now reads as under :
3. Exemption from the application of rules. -
(1) Nothing contained in the Rules shall apply to the import of any goods,
(i) by any person through the post or otherwise for his personal use subject to compliance of other Laws/Rules/Orders/Regulations in force.

9. By issue of notification 16/2015-20, dated 12th July 2017, DGFT has removed the value cap of Rs. 2000.00 w.r.t to personal imports, as well as, fully aligned the chapter notes in ITCHS with those enacted under Chapter 98 of the Customs Tariff. Personal imports would be considered as "free", except those items which are appearing in the list of "restricted" items or "prohibited" items or where they are regulated by any other law for the time being in force, subject to a de minimus clause or a clause for personal imports provided in such law. (As regards definitions of the words "restricted" and "prohibited", chapter 9 of the Foreign Trade Policy 2015-20 may be referred)
9.1 The net effect of all the above changes is that any personal import, whether by courier or post or by Air or Sea shall be classified under tariff heading 9804 of the Customs Tariff.
9.2 In this connection, clarification has been sought as to what constitutes personal import? Customs Act, 1962 does not define personal import. However, the Handbook of Procedures carries a definition of personal imports in para 2.07(a)(iii), which is as follows :

Persons importing or exporting goods for personal use not connected with trade or manufacture or agriculture.
9.3 Further, where an IEC code becomes necessary, such as for filing a Bill of Entry, the HBoP provides for using a default code (0100000053) for :

Persons/Institutions/Hospitals importing or exporting goods for personal use, not connected with trade or manufacture or Agriculture.
9.4 Accordingly, field formations are advised to rely upon the above definitions for the purposes of determining whether an import falls within the chapter heading 9804 .
10. In so far as imports by post are concerned, it is recognized that Posts is a unique eco-system of clearance in comparison with other modes of clearance of imported goods. Unlike other eco-systems, imports by post are both trackable as well as non-trackable. Manifests, as available in other ecosystems, containing details of consignor/consignee, their addresses and

value/description of goods are not being captured or exchanged universally between postal authorities. Data exchange between postal authorities, globally, is at very nascent stages/pilot stages. India Post is still in the process of joining data exchange systems, such as UPU-WCO's SECUREX and other systems which are being worked out bi-laterally with some other countries. In other words, the basic prerequisite of release of goods, namely, filing of declaration and deposit of duty, cannot be provided with any consistence in the current postal environment.
11. Keeping the above in view, chapter XI of the Customs Act was amended by deleting section 82, while section 84 was amended to provide for issue of regulations to provide a form and manner for making entry in respect of imports and exports by post. However, compliance to a system for filing of declaration for personal imports requires a robust electronic communication system between an importer and Customs/Post. Such a system requires added functionalities in postal tracking system, which are still underway, and therefore the traditional system of relying upon CN 22 and CN 23 will continue for the time being. It may be noted that under notification 50/2017Cus., dated 1-7-2017 (Sl. No. 608A) bona fide gifts up to a CIF value of Rs. 5000=00 (Rs. Five Thousand only) intended for personal use have been exempted from duty.
12. In view of the amendments carried out to heading 9804, it follows by principle of exclusion, that imports by a legal person (firms, companies, other forms of business entities) or which are for trade, manufacture or agriculture, cannot be regarded as personal imports and shall not fall within CTH 9804. Such imports by post shall be classified as per Customs Tariff and shall require an IEC, except as provided under para 2.07 of the HBoP 2015-20.
13. Since any import other than personal would be in furtherance of business, there is a requirement of filing a declaration, payment of customs duties \& IGST, which is to be available as credit to the importer. Also, compliance of foreign exchange remittance for imported goods requires a customs declaration. All these requirements necessitate filing of a bill of entry, which is not possible in the postal clearance eco-system. Accordingly, imports

by legal persons or imports connected with trade or manufacture or agriculture would require that the importer file a bill of entry at a jurisdictional customs station with EDI facility for payment of duties provided that the CIF value exceeds Rs. 1000 (Rupees One Thousand only) [notification 50/2017 Sl. No: 610 refers]. It may also be noted that import of commercial samples under notification 154/94-Cus., dated 13-7-1994, as amended, warrants filing a Bill of Entry as it is limited to IEC holders and subject to various other conditions including value limits.
14. In order to provide time for the trade to adopt new procedures and Commissionerates to put in place commensurate administrative arrangements, the new Regulations come into effect from 21st June 2018.
15. Difficulties, if any, should be brought to the notice of the Board

E-commerce exports through Post and clarification on personal import - Procedure simplified - M.F. (D.R.) Circular No. 18/2018-Cus., dated 13-6-2018
F.No. 476/02/2016-LC

Government of India
Ministry of Finance (Department of Revenue)
Central Board of Indirect Taxes \& Customs, New Delhi

Subject: Procedure for e-commerce exports through Post and clarification regarding personal imports.

Circular No. 14/2018-Customs, dated 4th June 2018 refers
2. During the course of stake holder consultations held in the Board on 11th June 2018, industry represented that there are large number of cases where low-value-small-shipments, which characterize e-commerce environment, are shipped through post. In such cases, single payments are received by exporters from e-commerce portal companies through normal banking channels. It has been represented that multiple shipments addressed to

multiple consignees should be permitted under Postal Bill of Export-II (Exports by Post Regulations, 2018 refer).
3. The matter has been examined by the Board. In order to facilitate exporters engaged in fulfilling multiple low-value-small-shipment orders, the Board has permitted that PBE-II may be used for this purpose. Para 4.3 of Circular 14/2018-Customs, dated 4th June 2018 stands modified to this extent.

Refund claim - Procedure for sanction of pending IGST refund claims where the records have not been transmitted from the GSTN to DG Systems - Circular No. 12/2018-Cus., dated 29-5-2018
F. No. 450/119/2017-Cus. IV

Government of India
Ministry of Finance (Department of Revenue)
Central Board of Indirect Taxes \& Customs, New Delhi
Subject: Sanction of pending IGST refund claims where the records have not been transmitted from the GSTN to DG Systems - Regarding.

A number of representations have been received from the exporters/trade associations seeking resolution of problems which have hindered sanction of refund of IGST paid on exports. From time to time, Board has provided solutions to a number of issues because of which refunds were held up. However, there is still one major hindrance because of which GSTN could not transmit data to Customs EDI system and consequently refunds could not be sanctioned. A validation has been introduced in the GSTN system to ensure that the IGST paid on the export goods in any particular month [3.1(b)] is not less than the refund claimed by the exporter [Table 6A]. However, data provided by GSTN has revealed that this validation has failed in number of cases.
2. Representations received from trade/exporters coupled with the analysis of data received from GSTN indicates that the exporters have committed mistakes while filing GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B. It has been observed that the

exporters have inadvertently misdeclared IGST paid on export supplies as IGST paid on inter-state domestic outward supplies while filing GSTR-3B. The exporters have also in certain cases short paid IGST vis-à-vis their liability declared in GSTR-1. As a result of these mismatches in the amount of IGST paid on export goods between GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B, the transmission of records from GSTN to Customs EDI system has not happened and consequently IGST refunds could not be processed. The problem is compounded by the fact that the facility to adjust GSTR-3B in subsequent months is not available in all cases.
3. In view of the above following procedure is being prescribed to overcome the problem of refund blockage. This would be an interim solution subject to undertakings/submission of CA certificates by the exporters as given below and post refund audit scrutiny. The proposed procedure is as under :
A. Cases where there is no short payment:
(i) The Customs policy wing would prepare a list of exporters whose cumulative IGST amount paid against exports and inter-state domestic outward supplies, for the period July' 2017 to March' 2018 mentioned in GSTR-3B is greater than or equal to the cumulative IGST amount indicated in GSTR-1 for the same period. Customs policy wing shall send this list to GSTN.
(ii) GSTN shall send a confirmatory e-mail to these exporters regarding the transmission of records to Customs EDI system.
(iii) The exporters whose refunds are processed/sanctioned would be required to submit a certificate from Chartered Accountant before 31st October, 2018 to the Customs office at the port of export to the effect that there is no discrepancy between the IGST amount refunded on exports and the actual IGST amount paid on exports of goods for the period July, 2017 to March, 2018. In case there are exports from multiple ports, the exporter is at liberty to choose any of the ports of export for submission of the said certificate.
(iv) A copy of the certificate shall also be submitted to the jurisdictional GST office (Central/State). The concerned Customs zone shall provide the list of GSTINs who have not submitted the CA certificate to the Board by the 15th November 2018.

(v) Non submission of CA certificate shall affect the future IGST refunds of the exporter.
(vi) The list of exporters whose refunds have been processed as above shall be sent to DG (Audit)/DG (GST) by the Board.
B. Cases where there is short payment :
(i) In cases where there is a short payment of IGST i.e. cumulative IGST amount paid against exports and inter-state domestic outward supplies together, for the period of July, 2017 to March, 2018 mentioned in GSTR-3B is less than the cumulative IGST amount indicated in GSTR-1 for the same period, the Customs policy wing would send the list of such exporters to the GSTN and all the Chief Commissioner of Customs
(ii) e-mails shall be sent by GSTN to each exporter referred in para (i) above so as to inform the exporter that their records are held up due to short payment of IGST. The e-mail shall also advise the exporters to observe the procedure under this circular.
(iii) The exporters would have to make the payment of IGST equal to the short payment in GSTR-3B of subsequent months so as to ensure that the total IGST refund being claimed in the Shipping Bill/GSTR-1(Table 6A) is paid. The proof of payment shall be submitted to Assistant/Deputy Commissioner of Customs in charge of port from where the exports were made. In case there are exports from multiple ports, the exporter is at liberty to choose any of the ports of export.
(iv) Where the aggregate IGST refund amount for the said period is upto Rs. 10 lacs, the exporter shall submit proof of payment (self-certified copy of challans) of IGST payment to the concerned Customs office at the port of export.

However, where the aggregate IGST refund amount for the said period is more than Rs. 10 lacs, the exporter shall submit proof of payment (selfcertified copy of challans) of IGST to the concerned Customs office at the port of export along with a certificate from chartered Account that the shortfall amount has been liquidated.
(v) The exporter would give an undertaking they would return the refund amount in case it is found to be not due to them at a later date.

(vi) The Customs zones shall compile the list of exporters (GSTIN only), who have come forward to claim refund after making requisite payment of IGST towards short paid amount and complied with other prescribed requirements. (vii) The compiled list may be forwarded to Customs policy wing, DG (Audit) and DG (GST). Customs policy wing shall forward the said list of GSTINs to GSTN. On receipt of the list of exporters from Customs policy wing, GSTN shall transmit the records of those exporters to Customs EDI system.
(viii) The exporters whose refunds are processed/sanctioned as above would be required to submit another certificate from Chartered Accountant before 31st October, 2018 to the same Customs office at the port of export to the effect that there is no discrepancy between the IGST amount refunded on exports and the actual IGST amount paid on exports of goods for the period July, 2017 to March, 2018. A copy of the certificate shall also be submitted to the jurisdictional GST office (Central/State). The concerned Customs zone shall provide the list of GSTINs who have not submitted the CA certificate to the Board by the 15th November 2018.
(ix) Non submission of CA certificate shall affect the future IGST refunds of the exporter.
Post refund audit
4. The exporters would be subjected to a post refund audit under the GST law. DG (Audit) shall include the above referred GSTINs for conducting Audit under the GST law. The inclusion of IGST refund aspects in Audit Plan of those units may be ensured by DG (Audit). In case, departmental Audit detects excess refunds to the exporters under this procedure, the details of such detections may be communicated to the concerned GST formations for appropriate action.
5. DG (GST) shall send the list of exporters to jurisdictional GST officers (both Centre/State) informing that these exporters have taken benefit of the procedure prescribed in this circular. The jurisdictional GST formations shall also verify the payment particulars at their end.
6. This Circular deals only with the cases where the records have not been transmitted by GSTN to Customs EDI system. Once the records are transmitted by GSTN to Customs System based upon the above mentioned procedure, the usual procedure adopted in case of sanction of IGST refunds

would have to be followed. In cases where the errors like SB005, SB002, SB006 etc. are encountered with the records so transmitted, the provisions of Circulars issued by Board earlier shall apply to them.
7. Field formations may, therefore, take necessary steps to bring these changes to the knowledge of exporters. Difficulties, if any, may be brought to the notice of the Board. Hindi version follows.

IGST - Refund of IGST on Export-Extension of date in SB005 alternate mechanism cases \& clarifications in other cases - Circular No. 8/2018Cus., dated 23-3-2018
F. No. 450/119/2017-Cus.IV

Government of India
Ministry of Finance (Department of Revenue)
Central Board of Excise \& Customs, New Delhi

Subject: Refund of IGST on Export-Extension of date in SB005 alternate mechanism cases \& clarifications in other cases - Regarding.

CBEC has issued Circular No. 5/2018-Customs dated 23-2-2018 which provided for an alternative mechanism with officer interface to resolve invoice mismatch cases. In the said circular, it was provided that the mechanism would be available for the shipping bills filed till 31-12-2017. Although the cases having SB005 error have now greatly reduced due to continuous outreach done by the Board and increased awareness amongst the trade, but some exporters have nevertheless, have committed errors in filing invoice details in shipping bill and GST returns. Therefore, keeping in view the difficulties likely to be faced by the exporters in case SB005 are allowed to be corrected through officer interface for SBs filed up to 31-12-2017, it has been decided to extend this facility to those shipping bills filed till 28-2-2018.
2. Further, representations have also been received from :
(i) field formations seeking resolution of SB006 errors due to discontinuance of transference copy of shipping bill. It has been proposed by

the field formations that in lieu of transference copy either the final Bill of Lading issued by the shipping lines or written confirmation from the custodian of the gateway port, may be treated as valid document for the purposes of integration with the EGM. The proposal from the field formation has been examined in the Board. The proposal sent from field formation in such EGM error cases has been agreed.
(ii) exporters that by mistake they have mentioned the status of IGST payment as "NA" instead of mentioning "P" in the shipping bill. In other words, the exporter has wrongly declared that the shipment is not under payment of IGST, despite the fact that they have paid the IGST. As a one-time exception, it has been decided to allow refund of IGST through an officer interface wherein the officer can verify and satisfy himself of the actual payment of IGST based on GST return information forwarded by GSTN. DG (Systems) shall open a physical interface for this purpose.
3. Difficulties if any should be brought to the notice of the Board.

Exports - Refund of IGST on Export - EGM Error related cases Procedure - M.F. (D.R.) Circular No. 6/2018-Cus., dated 16-3-2018
F.No. 450/119/2017-Cus.IV(Pt)

Subject: Refund of IGST on Export - EGM Error related cases - reg.

IGST Refund module for exports is operational in ICES from 10-10-2017. The module has an inbuilt procedure to automatically grant refund after validating the Shipping Bill data available with Customs against the GST Returns data available with GSTN. The procedure also returns error/response codes in case there is any discrepancy. A number of representations have been received from the stakeholders seeking resolution of various problems encountered in

sanction of refund of IGST paid on exports of goods. To address the problems related to IGST refund, CBEC has already issued Circular No. 42/2017Customs, dated 7-11-2017 [2017 (355) E.L.T. (T22)] which highlighted the common errors and combination of error that hindered the sanction and disbursal of refund of IGST paid against exports. Vide Circular No. 5/2018Customs, dated 23-2-2018 [2018 (359) E.L.T. (T83)], an officer interface in case of invoice mis-match errors, which accounted for the largest proportion of errors, was introduced. The other main category of errors holding up the refunds in Inland Container Depots (ICDs) is related to either non-filing of Export General Manifest at the gateway port or information mis-match between local and gateway EGMs.
2. As per Rule 96 of the CGST Rules, 2017, the shipping bill filed by an exporter shall be deemed to be an application for refund of intergrated tax paid on the goods exported out of India, once both the Export General Manifest (EGM) and valid return in Form GSTR-3 or Form GSTR-3B, as the case may be, has been filed. In other words, filing of EGM, apart from filing of shipping bill and GSTR 3B is a mandatory requirement for processing refund claim. The Shipping lines/agents have been filing EGM electronically for exports originating from gateway ports. However, for cargo originating from ICDs, the Shipping lines/agents were filing EGM in manual mode. Absence of electronic EGMs and their integration with local EGMs has been the major obstacle in processing of refund claims in the case of exports from ICDs.
3. In Order to overcome this issue, the Shipping lines have been mandated to include the shipping bills originating from ICDs while filing the electronic EGMs at the gateway ports. In cases where the EGMs have not incorporated the shipping bills pertaining to ICDs, the Shipping lines/agents have been asked to file supplementary EGMs. While the Shipping lines have been largely cooperative in filling regular or supplementary EGMs for cargo originating from ICDS, there are still many instances where no EGMs have been filed or EGMs have been filed with errors. This is causing avoidable delay in processing of refund claims. The jurisdictional officers at the gateway port may initiate swift penal action against Shipping lines/agents who fail to file either regular or supplementary EGMs electronically for the cargo originating from ICDs.

4. In order to ensure a hassle free processing of refund claims, the following steps may be ensured by the jurisdictional officers in ICDs: (a) filing of local EGM i.e train or truck summary, as the case may be, immediately after cargo leaves the port, (b) liaising with jurisdictional officers at gateway port for incorporation of Shipping Bills pertaining to the cargo originating in ICDs, in the EGMs filed at gateway port by the Shipping lines/agents (c) rectification of errors in local and gateway EGM, wherever necessary.
5. The jurisdictional officers at the gateway port should strictly monitor the EGM pendency and error reports available in ICES. The officers at the gateway port have to resolve the EGM errors in an expeditious manner by asking the Shipping lines/agents to file requisite amendments and approving those amendments on ICES. In cases, where there are errors either in the shipping bill or in the local EGM (i.e. truck or train summary), the remedial action has to be taken by jurisdictional officer in ICD.
6. It has been observed that mis-match of information provided in local and gateway EGM mainly occurs because of (i) incorrect gateway port code in local EGM (error M), (ii) change in container for LCL cargo or mistakes committed while entering container number (error C), (iii) incorrect count of containers (error N), (iv) mistakes in entering the nature of cargo - LCL or FCL (error T), (v) the let export order is given in ICES after sailing date of the vessel (error L), ICES has provision to correct all aforementioned errors. The procedure to be followed for each type of error has been clearly delineated in the step by step guide issued by the Directorate of Systems for dealing with the errors. In case of specific difficulties, the same may be taken with the errors. In case of specified difficulties, the same may be taken up with Directorate of Systems.
7. There is a shared responsibility between officers working at ICDs and gateway ports in ensuring an error free filing and integration of local and gateway EGMs. The officers at both locations should also ensure swift rectification of errors and effective coordination between the domestic carriers, who file local EGMs, and Shipping lines/agents, who file gateway EGMs. The error free filing and integration of EGMs is a pre-requisite for smooth processing of refunds. Recognizing this necessary outreach may be done to sensitize domestic carriers as well as Shipping lines/agents with

regard to due diligence that is required in filing of EGMs and its critical importance in hassle free processing of IGST refunds.
8. Difficulties if any should be brought to the notice of the Board.

Exports - Refund of IGST on Export - Invoice mis-match Cases Alternative Mechanism with Officer Interface - Procedure - M.F. (D.R.) Circular No. 5/2018-Cus., dated 23-2-2018
F.No. 450/119/2017-Cus.IV

Subject: Refund of IGST on Export - Invoice mis-match Cases - Alternative Mechanism with Officer Interface - Regarding.

1. Numerous representations have been received from exporters/trade associations seeking resolution of various problems which have hindered the sanction of refund of IGST paid on exports. CBEC has issued Circular No. 42/2017-Cus., dated 7-11-2017 which highlighted the common errors that hindered the sanction and disbursal of refund of IGST paid against exports. Subsequent to the said Circular, outreach programmes have been undertaken and advisories, advertisements and FAQs have been issued to create awareness amongst the exporter community regarding the common mistakes and errors which hold up the refund process. Information is being made available to exporters on a real-time basis with regard to the errors status on ICEGATE website for registered users. Details of refund sanctioned is being sent through SMS on registered mobile phones. A positive gain of these efforts has been that errors are steadily decreasing, which has enabled CBEC to sanction more than Rs. 4000 crores of refund, so far. The matter is being closely coordinated with GSTN, which has also been tasked to provide

feedback to the exporter about any failed validations to enable corrective action on their part.
2. The analysis of data post October, 2017 indicates that while the quantum of errors is decreasing significantly, exporters are still committing mistakes in the information furnished to (i) GSTN while filing GSTR-1/Table 6A or GSTR3B and (ii) Customs EDI system while filing Shipping Bill. The pre-requisites and precautions that need to be taken for successful processing of refund claims are as follows :
(i) Exporters have to file GSTR-3B with taxable value for export and IGST paid against exports indicated in appropriate fields.
(ii) Exporters have to file GSTR-1 or Table 6A for the exports made with correct details such as Invoice number, Taxable value, IGST paid, Shipping Bill number, Shipping Date and Port Code. Large number of exporters have filed incomplete GSTR-1 or Table 6A where shipping bill number or date or port code are missing. These records are not processed/forwarded to Customs by GSTN. E-mails have been sent to exporters asking them to correct their records through amendment process of GSTR-1 i.e. through Table 9 of GSTR-1 of the following month.
(iii) The aggregate IGST paid amount claimed in GSTR-1 or Table 6A should not be greater than the IGST paid amount indicated in Table 3.1(b) of GSTR3B of the corresponding month. This check is put in the GSTN system to ensure that the refund claimed is not more than the IGST paid by the exporter. Analysis of GSTN return data indicates that this condition has failed in a large number of cases, consequently, the information filed by exporters is not forwarded to Customs by GSTN. In these cases also, e-mails have been sent to exporters asking them to correct their records through amendment process of GSTR-1 i.e. through Table 9 of GSTR-1 of the following month.
(iv) The analysis of data further indicates that only about $32 \%$ records of GSTR-1/Table 6A have been transmitted from GSTN to Customs. In other words, a majority of refund claims are held up either due to insufficient information or lack of due diligence on the part of exporter while filing GST returns.
(v) Exporters may be advised to use Table 9 of GSTR-1 of the following month to amend the records of previous month so as to take care of issues

mentioned in paras (ii) and (iii) above. In cases where exporters have already filed information through Table 9 of GSTR-1, the said information is being validated by GSTN. The validated information is expected to be forwarded by GSTN to Customs by mid-March, 2018 for further processing.
(vi) The records (i.e. GSTR-1 or Table 6A) which have been forwarded by GSTN to Customs after validations mentioned at (ii) and (iii) above are processed by the Customs EDI system. In cases where the information forwarded by GSTN tallies with the information furnished in Shipping bills, refunds are automatically sanctioned by Customs EDI system. As mentioned earlier, till date about Rs. 4000 Crore has been sanctioned as refund of IGST paid.
(vii) However, there are many instances where refunds are held up on Customs EDI system due to certain errors which have been clearly brought out in the Circular No. 42/2017-Customs. The major errors that are committed by the exporters are (a) incorrect Shipping bill numbers in GSTR-1 (b) GSTIN declared in the shipping bill does not match with the GSTIN used to file the corresponding GST Returns (c) the most common error hampering refund is due to mismatch of invoice number, taxable value and IGST paid in the Shipping Bill vis-à-vis the same details mentioned in GSTR-1/Table 6A which is the most common error hampering refund. Another reason attributable to carriers is the non-filing or incorrect filing of electronic Export General Manifest (EGM).
(viii) Exporters may be advised to track the refund status and errors pertaining to their shipping bills on the ICEGATE website. The registration process demo, advisory and the needed IT configurations are hosted on the ICEGATE website under the following links.

Java set up for the DSC upload :
https://www.icegate.gov.in/Download/JavaSetupForDSC.pdf

Once the registration is obtained, the exporters can check the status of IGST refunds associated with their exports and the corresponding error message, if any. This enquiry takes GSTIN Number, Port-code and Return Month as inputs and based on the input, Shipping Bill Number, Shipping Bill Date, Return Month, Invoice Number, Invoice Date, Response Code and Processed date is displayed as a result of the enquiry. The records displayed are those that have been received from GSTN and processed by the Customs Automated System.
(ix) The analysis of Customs data indicates that while most of the errors mentioned in para (vi) above are decreasing, the error mentioned at (c) in para (vii) is most prevalent. The error mentioned at (c) in para (vii) is about invoice mis-match. This error is because of the fact that exporters are using two sets of invoices, one invoice for GST and another invoice for Customs which is resulting in mis-match of invoice numbers, including mis-match in taxable value and IGST paid in those invoices. It is once again reiterated that exporters may be advised to take due care to ensure that the details of invoice such as invoice number, taxable value and IGST paid mentioned in GSTR-1 and shipping bill match with each other and the invoice issued is compliant with the GST Invoice Rules, 2017.
3. Recognizing that invoice mis-match has been the major reason why the refunds have been held, it has been decided to provide an alternative mechanism to give exporters an opportunity to rectify such errors committed in the initial stages. This envisages an officer interface on the Customs EDI System through which a Customs officer can verify the information furnished in GSTN and Customs EDI system and sanction refund in those cases where invoice details provided in GSTR-1/Table 6A are correct though the said details provided in the shipping bill were at variance. It is pertinent to note that refund claims would be processed in only those cases where the error code is mentioned as SB005. Further, it may also be noted that all refunds shall continue to be credited electronically through the PFMS system, and no manual payment/cheque should be issued. The procedure for processing of IGST refund claims in these cases would be as follows :
(a) The exporter shall provide a concordance table indicating mapping between GST invoices and corresponding Shipping Bill invoices, as annexed in

support of the refund claim to the designated officer in the Custom House. A scanned copy of concordance table may also be sent to dedicated email address of Customs location from where exports took place.
(b) Customs EDI system shall display list of all the invoices pertaining to such SBs vis-a-vis the invoice data received from GSTN. The officer shall verify the following :
(i) Duly certified concordance table submitted by the exporter as per Annexure A indicating mapping between GST invoice and corresponding Shipping Bill invoice;
(ii) IGST taxable value and IGST amount declared in the Shipping Bill.
(iii) IGST details declared in the Shipping Bill should be in proportion to the goods actually exported.
(c) After determining the correct refund amount, the officer need to enter the same into the Customs EDI system. The officer has the facility to edit the IGST paid details in case of short shipment or incorrect calculation by the exporter. The officer shall complete the verification by accepting or rejecting or amending the same.
(d) Once all the invoices pertaining to Shipping Bill are verified by the officer, the system shall calculate the scroll amount against a shipping bill, after subtracting the drawback amount for each invoice where applicable, and display the refund amount to the officer for approval.
(e) Invoices in any particular GSTR-1 where refund is sanctioned shall be disabled in the system to prevent refund against same invoice in future.
(f). Once refund is sanctioned by the officer, the shipping bills would be available for generating scroll as per normal process.
4. In order to ensure smooth operation of the prescribed procedure, Custom Houses may open a dedicated cell and e-mail address for the purpose of IGST refund and give wide publicity.
5. This procedure is available only for Shipping Bills filed till 31st December, 2017. All Chief Commissioners are requested to issue Public Notice and Standing Orders, in this regard. Difficulties, if any, may be brought to the notice of the Board. It is again emphasized that Board is taking all possible steps to alleviate the difficulties associated with IGST refunds. However,

ultimately it is the responsibility of the exporters to ensure careful and correct filing of returns for hassle free sanction of IGST refunds.

Refunds of IGST paid on export of goods under Rule 96 of CGST Rules, 2017 - Circular No. 42/2017-Cus., dated 7-11-2017
F. No. 450/119/2017-Cus. IV

Government of India
Ministry of Finance (Department of Revenue)
Central Board of Excise \& Customs, New Delhi
Subject: Refunds of IGST paid on export of goods under Rule 96 of CGST Rules, 2017

The GST Council in its 22nd Meeting had approved a major relief package for exporters. The Council was unanimous that it is in the national interest to take all possible measures to support the exporting community, which earns valuable foreign exchange and provides significant employment especially in the small and medium sector. The Council approved that by 10-10-2017 the refund of IGST paid on goods exported in July would begin to be paid and refunds for subsequent months would be handled expeditiously. In line with the government's commitment, CBEC has already issued suitable instructions to expeditiously disburse the refund of IGST paid on goods exported out of India. Also, with effect from 10th October, 2017, the refund is getting disbursed for the export of goods made in July, 2017. In cases where the

exporter has filed GSTR-3B and the information furnished by the exporters in the GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B is matching with the details filed by them in Shipping bills, the refunds have already been disbursed. But there are many cases where the refund of IGST could not be done due to errors in the EGM/GSTR-1 return/Shipping Bill. The analysis of the common errors that are hindering the disbursal of IGST refund, and decisions taken to address such errors are as follows :
A. IGST refunds for the exports of goods in the month of July, 2017 :
(i) Incorrect SB number in GSTR-1

There are cases where the shipping bill number quoted in GSTR-1 either does not exist or it pertains to another exporter. In respect of these claims, the only way out is to amend the GSTR-1 (Amendments to taxable outward supply details furnished in returns for earlier tax periods) and enter the correct shipping bill number. In these cases, the amendments for information furnished in GSTR-1 for July, 2017 need to be filed in Table 9A of GSTR-1 for August, 2017. GSTN has been asked to provide for immediate implementation of this Table so that all such claims can be processed once amendment is filed.
(ii) Invoice number and IGST paid amount mismatch

Analysis of data revealed that exporters have quoted different invoice numbers for GST and Customs purposes. Also, IGST paid amount indicated in GSTR-1 is not tallying with IGST paid amount indicated in shipping bill. As the same transaction is being reported under GST Act and under Customs Act, the exporters may take care to ensure the details of invoice, such as Invoice number, IGST paid etc., under GSTR-1 and shipping bill match with each other. (iii) EGM Error

Due to either mismatch in information furnished in Export General Manifest (EGM) vis-à-vis shipping bill or non-filing of EGM in certain cases, the compliance of 'exported out of India' requirement in Rule 96(2) of Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST) Rules, 2017 remained unfulfilled. It is also noticed that Gateway EGM in case of many ICD's Shipping Bills have been manually filed, due to which the system is unable to match the EGM details. Hence, it is to be ensured that all the shipping lines operating in ICDs/Gateway ports file EGM online. All ICDs and Gateway ports have already been instructed to ensure that shipping lines file supplementary EGM online

for the consignments exported in July, 2017 by 31st October. For subsequent months also, the ICDs must ensure that the shipping lines invariably file the Gateway EGM online. In cases where supplementary EGM have been filed successfully, refunds are already being given.
(iv) Wrong Bank Account given to Customs

In some cases, bank account details available with Customs have been invalidated by PFMS. Reports on such accounts/ IECs have been provided to the Commissionerates by the Directorate of Systems in ICES and by email. Exporters may be advised that if the account has not been validated by PFMS, they must get their details corrected in the EDI system. Exporters are also advised not to change their bank account details frequently so as to avoid delay in refund payment.
B. IGST Refunds for the export of goods in the month of August, 2017 :

GSTN has provided the utility to declare Table 6A in GSTR-1 for exporters to fill in information related to Zero Rated Supplies. Once exporters file Table 6A, it would be possible to sanction refunds for the exports made in August, 2017. Thus Public/Trade notices may be issued emphasizing the need to fill Table 6A online by exporters to claim refunds against exports made in August, 2017. Exporters have already been provided an option to view their Shipping Bill data online on ICEGATE website, so that they can ensure filing of their Table 6A without any error. All necessary steps may be taken to make exporters aware that the common errors that hindered disbursal of IGST refunds in July are not repeated in subsequent months.
2. The GST council in its 22 nd meeting has also approved the GST rate of $0.1 \%$ for supplies to merchant exporters and Notification No. 41/2017Integrated Tax (Rate), Notification No. 40/2017-CGST (Rate) and Notification No. 40/2017-UTGST (Rate), all dated 23rd October, 2017 have been issued to that effect. The said benefit is subject to the conditions mentioned in aforementioned notifications. The merchant exporters are advised to take following precautions to avail the benefit of the scheme :
(i) The Name and GSTIN of the Registered Supplier should be provided against each item in Third Party details column of Shipping Bill. The GST Invoice details of the registered supplier of each item should be declared in the ARE Certificate and Date columns in the Shipping Bill format. Necessary

changes have already been done in ICES application. The third party details would be printed in the shipping bill copies for fulfilment of the notification conditions.
(ii) Further in case of an export consignment containing multiple supplies by registered suppliers, the registered recipient (merchant exporters) need to provide details of all registered suppliers and corresponding invoices against each item in the Shipping bills.
(iii) For the purpose of above mentioned notifications concerning supply to registered recipient at concessional GST, registered principal place of business or registered additional place of business shall be deemed to be a "registered warehouse".
(iv) Registered recipients (Merchant exporters) may, if required, exclude commercially sensitive information while providing copies of Shipping Bills to registered suppliers.
3. Difficulties if any should be brought to the notice of the Board.
4. Hindi version follows.

Export procedure and sealing of containerized cargo under GST Circular No. 26/2017-Cus., dated 1-7-2017
F.No. 450/08/2015-Cus.IV

Government of India
Ministry of Finance (Department of Revenue)
Central Board of Excise \& Customs, New Delhi

Subject: Export procedure and sealing of containerized cargo-regarding.

Goods and Service Tax has become operational from 1-7-2017. In the GST regime, the governing provisions related to exports are contained in section 16 of the Integrated Goods and Service Tax Act, 2017 (IGST Act). Supplies of goods and services for exports have been categorized as 'Zero Rated Supply' implying that goods could be exported under bond or Letter of Undertaking

without payment of integrated tax followed by claim of refund of unutilized input tax credit or on payment of integrated tax with provision for refund of the tax paid.
2. With the onset of GST, extant procedures relating to export of goods viz. claim of rebate/refund, stuffing of containers at the factory, warehouse or any other place from where the goods are intended to be exported etc. would require review of the existing procedures. In this regard, attention is drawn to Notification No's 42/2001-C.E. (N.T.) to 45/2001-C.E. (N.T.) both dated 26-62001 detailing the procedure to be followed for the export of goods on payment of terminal excise duty and 19/2004-C.E. (N.T.) and 20/2004-C.E. (N.T.), both dated 6-9-2004, without payment thereof.
A. Procedure of Export
3. Any person making zero rated supply (i.e. any exporter) shall be eligible to claim refund under either of the following options, namely :-
(a) he may supply goods or services or both under bond or Letter of Undertaking, subject to such conditions, safeguards and procedure as may be prescribed, without payment of integrated tax and claim refund of unutilized input tax credit; or
(b) he may supply goods or services or both, subject to such conditions, safeguards and procedure as may be prescribed, on payment of integrated tax and claim refund of such tax paid on goods or services or both supplied, in accordance with the provisions of section 54 (Refunds) of the Central Goods and Services Tax Act or the rules made there under (i.e. the Central Goods and Service Tax Rules, 2017).
4. For the option (a) above, procedure to file refund has been outlined in the Central Goods and Service Tax Rules, 2017. The exporter claiming refund of unutilized input tax credit will file an application electronically through the Common Portal, either directly or through a Facilitation Centre notified by the GST Commissioner. The application shall be accompanied by documents as prescribed in the said rules. Application for refund shall be filed only after the export manifest or an export report, as the case may be, is delivered under section 41 of the Customs Act, 1962 in respect of such goods. The formats for furnishing bond or LUT for export of goods have been separately notified

under CGST Rules, 2017. The said formats are attached herewith for easy reference.
5. For the option (b), broadly the procedure is that a registered person shall not be required to file any application for refund of integrated goods and services tax paid on supply of goods for exports. The shipping bill, having inter alia GST invoice details, filed by an exporter shall be deemed to be an application for refund of integrated tax paid on the goods exported out of India and such application shall be deemed to have been filed only when the person in charge of the conveyance carrying the export goods duly files an export manifest or an export report covering the number and the date of shipping bills or bills of export and the applicant has furnished a valid return in FORM GSTR-3. The details of the relevant export invoices contained in FORM GSTR-1 shall be transmitted electronically by the common portal to the Customs system and the said system shall in turn electronically transmit back to the common portal a confirmation that the goods covered by the said invoices have been exported out of India. Upon receipt of information regarding furnishing of valid return in FORM GSTR-3 from the common portal, the Customs system shall process the claim for refund and an amount equal to the integrated tax paid in respect of each shipping bill or bill of export shall be electronically credited to the bank account of the applicant mentioned in his registration particulars. Government has allowed a grace period to the registrants to file returns under the new GST Law. Therefore, this refund procedure shall as a consequence come into operation only when the registrants file the above mentioned returns. Further, the exporters are free to avail option (a) or option (b). The refund shall be governed by the provisions of the section 16 of the IGST Act.
6. In order to ensure smooth transition from the earlier export procedure to the procedure being laid down for export of goods under the GST regime, the existing Shipping Bill formats (both manual/electronic) have been modified to make them compliant with the IGST law. New formats of the Shipping Bill have been made applicable already. ARE-1 procedure which was being followed is dispensed with except in respect of commodities to which provisions of Central Excise Act would continue to be applicable.
B. Sealing of Containers

7. Board has in the past issued various circulars both on the Excise and Customs side on the issue of sealing of containers. A gist of these Circulars and the subject matter dealt in them is given in the annexure to this circular. At present, there are three categories of containers which arrive at the port/ICD :
a. Containers stuffed at factory premises or warehouse under self-sealing procedure.
b. Containers stuffed/sealed at factory premises or warehouse under supervision of central excise officer.
c. Containers stuffed and sealed at Container Freight Stations/Inland Container Depot.
8. For the sake of uniformity and ease of doing business, Board has decided to simplify the procedure relating to factory stuffing hitherto carried out under the supervision of the Central Excise officers. It is the endeavor of the Board to create a trust based environment where compliance in accordance with the extant laws is ensured by strengthening Risk Management System and Intelligence setup of the department. Accordingly, Board has decided to lay down a simplified procedure for stuffing and sealing of export goods in containers.
9. It has been decided to do away with the sealing of containers with export goods by CBEC officials. Instead, self-sealing procedure shall be followed subject to the following :
i. The exporter shall be under an obligation to inform the details of the premises whether a factory or warehouse or any other place where container stuffing is to be carried out, to the jurisdictional customs officer.
ii. The exporter should be registered under the GST and should be filing GSTR1 and GSTR2. Where exporter is not a GST registrant, he shall bring the export goods to a Container Freight Station/Inland Container Depot for stuffing and sealing of container. However, in certain situations, an exporter may follow the self-sealing procedure even if he is not required to be registered under GST Laws. Such an exception is available to the Status Holders recognized by DGFT under a valid status holder certificate issued in this regard.
iii. Any exporter desirous of availing this procedure shall inform the jurisdictional Custom Officer of the rank of Superintendent or Appraiser of

Customs, at least 15 days before the first planned movement of a consignment from his/her factory/premises, about the intention to follow self-sealing procedure to export goods from the factory premises or warehouse. The jurisdictional Superintendent or an Appraiser or an Inspector of Customs shall visit the premises from where the export goods will be stuffed \& sealed for export. The jurisdictional Superintendent or Inspector of Customs shall inspect the premises with regard to viability of stuffing of container in the premises and submit a report to the jurisdictional Deputy Commissioner of Customs or as the case may be the Assistant Commissioner of Customs within 48 hours. The jurisdictional Deputy Commissioner of Customs or as the case may be the Assistant Commissioner of Customs shall forward the proposal, in this regard to the Principal Commissioner/ Commissioner of Customs who would grant permission for self-sealing at the approved premises. Once the permission is granted, the exporter shall furnish only intimation to the jurisdictional Superintendent or Customs each time self-sealing is carried out at approved premises. The intimation, in this regard shall clearly mention the place and address of the approved premises, description of export goods and whether or not any incentive is being claimed.
iv. Where the visit report of the Superintendent or an Appraiser or an Inspector of Customs regarding viability of the stuffing at the factory/premises is not favorable, the exporter shall bring the goods to the Container Freight Station/Inland Container Depot/Port for sealing purposes.
v. Self-Sealing permission once given by a Principal Commissioner/ Commissioner of Customs shall be valid for export at all the customs stations. The customs formation granting the self-sealing permission shall circulate the permission along with GSTIN of the exporter to all Custom Houses/Station concerned.
vi. Transport document for movement of self-sealed container by an exporter from factory or warehouse shall be same as the transport document prescribed under the GST Laws. In the case of an exporter who is not a GST registrant, way bill or transport challan or lorry receipt shall be the transport document.
vii. The exporter shall seal the container with the tamper proof electronicseal of standard specification. The electronic seal should have a unique

number which should be declared in the Shipping Bill. Before sealing the container, the exporter shall feed the data such as name of the exporter, IEC code, GSTIN number, description of the goods, tax invoice number, name of the authorized signatory (for affixing the e-seal) and Shipping Bill number in the electronic seal. Thereafter, container shall be sealed with the same electronic seal before leaving the premises.
viii. The exporter intending to clear export goods on self-clearance (without employing a Customs Broker) shall file the Shipping Bill under digital signature.
ix. All consignments in self-sealed containers shall be subject to risk based criteria and intelligence, if any, for examination/inspection at the port of export. At the port/ICD as the case may be, the customs officer would verify the integrity of the electronic seals to check for tampering if any enroute. The Risk Management System (RMS) is being suitably revamped to improvise the interdiction/examination norms. However, random or intelligence based selection of such containers for examination/scanning would continue.
10. Board has decided that the above revised procedure regarding sealing of containers shall be effective from 1-9-2017. A future date has been prescribed since the returns under GST have been permitted to be filed by 10-9-2017 and also with the purpose to give enough time to the stakeholders to adapt to the new procedures. Therefore, as a measure of facilitation, the existing practice of sealing the container with a bottle seal under Central Excise supervision or otherwise would continue. The extant circulars shall stand modified on 1-92017 to the extent the earlier procedure is contrary to the revised instructions given in this circular.
11. Suitable public Notices may be issued in this regard. Difficulty faced, if any, may be brought to the notice of the Board.
12. Hindi version will follow.

Export of goods - Refund of IGST paid on export of goods under Rule 96 of CGST Rules, 2017 - Instructions - Instruction No. 16/2017-Cus., dated $9-10-2017$
F. No. 450/119/2017-Cus IV

Government of India
Ministry of Finance (Department of Revenue)
Central Board of Excise \& Customs, New Delhi

Subject: Refund of IGST paid on export of goods under Rule 96 of CGST Rules, 2017 - Regarding.

Your attention is invited to Instruction No. 15/2017-Customs, dated 9-102017 on the aforementioned subject. In this regard a letter has been received from Chief Controller of Account wherein they have expressed their inability to initiate the process of disbursement of IGST refund through PFMS portal

from 10-10-2017 due to ongoing migration of existing hardware \& software infrastructure of PFMS.
2. In the given circumstances, Chief Controller of Account has proposed to use the existing tax refund payment system for refund payment of IGST on exports. In the existing system the concerned departmental officer (Assistant Commissioner/Deputy Commissioner of the Customs Commissionerate) issues a single cheque to the bank along with a list of exporters containing details of their bank accounts, amount of refund etc. Against the single cheque of consolidated amount of refund, the authorized bank credits the bank account of the exporters mentioned in the list through ECS/NEFT/RTGS. The cheque books for this purpose are provided by the field PAOs to the departmental officers.
3. In view of above it is directed to use the existing system to make immediate payment of refund of IGST on Exports w.e.f. 10th October, 2017 till 14th October, 2017. The payment through PFMS portal would be started from 16th October, 2017. The cheque books presently being used for refund payments may also be used for refund of IGST on exports by the Departmental Officers. In case of requirement of additional cheque books by the Customs formations, the same may be provided by the concerned PAO.
4. This issues with the approval of Member (Customs).

Export of Goods - Refund of IGST paid on export of goods under Rule 96 of CGST Rules, 2017 - Instructions - Instruction No. 15/2017-Cus., dated $9-10-2017$
F. No. 450/119/2017-Cus IV

Government of India
Ministry of Finance (Department of Revenue)
Central Board of Excise \& Customs, New Delhi

Subject: Refund of IGST paid on export of goods under Rule 96 of CGST Rules, 2017.

As you are aware, Rule 96 of the CGST Rules, 2017 deals with refund of Integrated Tax paid on goods exported out of India. It provides that the shipping bill filed by an exporter shall be deemed to be an application for refund of integrated tax paid on the goods exported out of India once export general manifest (EGM) and valid return in Form GSTR-3 or Form GSTR-3B, as the case may be has been filed. Once these conditions are met, the Customs System shall process the claim for refund and an amount equal to the integrated tax paid in respect of each shipping bill or bill of export shall be electronically credited to the bank account of the applicant mentioned in his registration particulars and as intimated to the Customs authorities.
2. The Committee on Exports setup by the GST Council has recommended that IGST refunds for exports made in July, 2017 must start by 10-10-2017. This recommendation has been endorsed by GST Council in its meeting on 6-10-2017. Necessary background work is being done by the Directorate General of Systems, GSTN and Controller General of Accounts (PFMS). In order to ensure that refunds start smoothly, following guidelines are issued for the field formations -

# Export General Manifest 

3. Filing of correct EGM is a must for treating shipping bill or bill of export as a refund claim. Commissioners must ensure that the concerned airlines/shipping lines/carriers file EGM/Export report within prescribed time. Cases which remain in EGM error due to any reason should be followed up to ensure that records are updated at the gateway port, especially for ICDs. Exporters may be advised that they should follow up with their carriers to ensure that correct EGM/export reports are filed in a timely manner.
Details of export supplies in Table 6A of GSTR-1
4. The details of zero rated supplies declared in Table 6A of return in Form GSTR-1 are matched electronically with the corresponding details available in Customs Systems as per details provided in shipping bills/bill of export. Thus exporters must file their GSTR-1 very carefully to ensure that all relevant details match. For their convenience, the details available in the Customs System have been made available for viewing in their ICEGATE login.

4.1 Exporters who have not filed their GSTR-1 for month of July, 2017 may be advised to do so immediately.
4.2 For month of August, 2017 and subsequent months, facility of filing GSTR-1 has not been made available by GSTN at present. In order to facilitate processing of refunds, GSTN is making available a separate utility for filing details in Table 6A of GSTR-1 on the GSTN Web portal. Exporters may be advised to submit the requisite details once GSTN develops the utility.
Valid return in Form GSTR-3 or Form GSTR-3B
5. Filing of valid return in GSTR-3 or GSTR-3B is another pre-condition for considering shipping bill/Bill of export as claim for refund. Exporters may be advised that they must file these returns expeditiously without waiting for the last date, to ensure that their refund is processed in a timely manner.

# Bank account details 

6. As per Rule 96 of CGST Rules, 2017, the refund is to be credited in the bank account of the applicant mentioned in his registration particulars. As a practice, exporters have been declaring details of bank account to Customs for the purpose of drawback etc. There is a possibility that bank account details available with Customs do not match with those declared in the GST registration form. In order to ensure smooth processing and payment of refund of IGST paid on exported goods, it has been decided that said refund amount shall be credited to the bank account of the exporter registered with Customs even if it is different from the bank account of the applicant mentioned in his registration particulars. However, exporters may be advised to either change the bank account declared to Customs to align it with their GST registration particulars or add the account declared with Customs in their GST registration details.
6.1 Further, as the refund payments are being routed through the PFMS portal, the bank account details need to be verified and validated by PFMS. The status of validation of bank account with PFMS is available in ICES. Exporters may be advised that if the account has not been validated by PFMS, they must get their details corrected in the Customs system so that their bank

account gets validated by PFMS. Exporters are also advised not to change their bank account details frequently to avoid delay in refund payment.

# Processing of refund claims 

7. Proper officer of each jurisdiction shall generate a payment scroll of eligible IGST refunds in the same manner as RoSL scrolls are generated. The scroll shall be transmitted electronically to PFMS system for onward payment into their bank accounts. Unlike RoSL where paper scrolls are to be sent by field formations, in this case, electronic verification will be done centrally by a DDO appointed in this regard. Detailed EDI procedure for processing of claims and generation of refund scrolls is being circulated by Directorate of Systems, CBEC. DG-Systems is also laying down the procedure for payment and accounting in consultation with Pr. CCA CBEC and CGA of India. Proper officers may be designated in each Commissionerate, who should be in readiness to start generating refund scrolls from 10-10-2017 onwards.
Handling of cases under Rule 96(4)(a)
8. Sub-rule (4)(a) of aforesaid Rule 96 provides that refund is to be withheld if a request has been received from the jurisdictional Commissioner of central tax, State tax or Union territory tax to withhold the payment of refund in accordance with the provisions of sub-section (10) or sub-section (11) of section 54. In such cases, the proper officer of integrated tax at the Customs station has to intimate withholding of refund to the applicant and the jurisdictional Commissioner of central tax, State tax or Union territory tax, as the case may be, and a copy of such intimation has to be transmitted to the common portal.
8.1 The Commissioners should put in place a mechanism for keeping record of such intimations received from jurisdictional Commissioner of central tax, State tax or Union territory tax and ensuring that refunds are not processed and sanctioned in such cases. Necessary communication to the applicant and the jurisdictional Commissioner of central tax, State tax or Union territory tax, in respect of claims withheld should be promptly sent. Mechanism to communicate the same to Common portal is being worked out and shall be communicated separately.

Exports in violation of the provisions of the Customs Act, 1962
9. In case where proper officer determines that the goods were exported in violation of the provisions of the Customs Act, 1962, IGST refund has to be withheld in terms sub-rule (4)(b) of aforesaid Rule 96. Accordingly, necessary action in such cases to ensure that IGST refund is withheld should be taken.
10. Guidelines and procedures for filing and processing of refunds of IGST paid on export goods for exports made under manual (non-EDI) shipping bills shall be communicated separately.
11. Suitable trade notices and standing orders should be issued for guidance of trade and officers respectively. Difficulties, if any, may be brought to the notice of the Board.

File FORM GST PMT 09, to transfer/shift the money available in Electronic Cash ledger, between various major and minor heads of GST

# 27/04/2020 

Taxpayers deposit money using challan and the paid amount gets credited in the particular head in the Electronic Cash ledger and the same can be utilized in settling liabilities of that head only. In case a taxpayer deposited any amount under a major head i.e. IGST, CGST, SGST/UTGST and Cess or minor head i.e. Tax, Interest, Penalty, Fee and Others, they can then utilize this amount for discharging their liabilities only under that major head and minor head. Sometimes, inadvertently, the taxpayer pays the amount under the wrong head and it cannot be used to discharge the liabilities which may be due in another head. In such cases taxpayers can claim the refund of the amount which may have been deposited under wrong head in GST by filing a refund application in FORM RFD-01 under the category "Excess balance in electronic cash ledger". The process of filing refund claim and its disbursement can sometimes lead to blockage of funds for the taxpayer.

Form GST PMT-09 is now available on GST portal and it enables a taxpayer to make intrahead or inter-head transfer of amount available in Electronic Cash Ledger. A taxpayer can file GST PMT 09 for transfer of any amount of tax, interest, penalty, fee or others available under one (major or minor) head to another (major or minor) head in the Electronic Cash Ledger. Form GST PMT 09 provides flexibility to taxpayers to make multiple transfers from more than one Major/Minor head to another Major/Minor head if the amount is available in the Electronic Cash Ledger. To file Form GST PMT-09 taxpayers are required to login on GST portal with valid credentials and navigate to Services > Ledgers > Electronic Cash Ledger > File GST PMT-09 For Transfer of Amount option. After Form GST PMT-09 is filed:

- ARN is generated on successful filing of Form GST PMT-09.

- An SMS and an email is sent to the taxpayer on his registered mobile and email id.
- Electronic Cash ledger will get updated after successful filing of Form GST PMT-09.
- Filed form GST PMT-09 will be available for view/download in PDF format.

A detailed FAQ and User Manual to guide taxpayer on Form PMT-09 has been provided on the GST Portal under the Help section click here

2. A tax officer can issue payment order only after Public Financial Management System (PFMS) has validated the bank account mentioned in the refund application (RFD-01). Similarly, final disbursement of refund amount sanctioned by the tax officer happens only after (PFMS) has validated the bank account mentioned in the payment order (RFD-05). Thus, validation of bank account takes place at two stages. However, the exact detailed status of bank account validation is not available on the GST Portal.
3. The Public Financial Management System (PFMS) of the Controller General of Accounts (CGA) has made available a central portal to track the status of bank account validation and disbursal of refund amount. By visiting the PFMS portal athhttps://pfms.nic.in/static/NewLayoutCommonContent.aspx?RequestPagename=Static/G STN_Tracker.aspx the taxpayer can track the status of bank account validation.
4. This advisory is being issued for the benefit of the taxpayers in order to make them aware of the ways in which they can track the status of their refund applications on both the Portals.
