# Annexure II <br> Residential Real estate project (RREP) 

Input tax credit attributable to construction of residential and commercial portion in a Residential Real estate project (RREP), which has time of supply on or after $1^{\text {st }}$ April, 2019, shall be calculated project wise for all projects which commence on or after $1^{\text {st }}$ April, 2019 or ongoing projects in respect of which the promoter has not exercised option to pay central tax on construction of apartments at the rates as specified for item (ie) or (if) against serial number 3, as the case may be, in the prescribed manner, before the due date for furnishing of the return for the month of September following the end of financial year 2018-19, in the followingmanner:

## 1. Where \% completion as on $31^{\text {st }}$ March, 2019 is not æro or where there is inventory in stock

(a) Input tax credit on inputs and input services attributable to construction of residential and commercial portion in an RREP, which has time of supply on or after $1^{\text {st }}$ April, 2019, may be denoted as $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{x}} . \mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{x}}$ shall be calculated asunder:
$\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{x}}=\mathrm{T}-\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{e}}$
Where,
T is the total ITC availed (utilized or not) on inputs and input services used in construction of the RREP from $1^{\text {st }}$ July, 2017 to $31^{\text {st }}$ March, 2019 including transitional credit taken on $1^{\text {st }}$ July,2017;
$\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{e}}$ is the eligible ITC attributable to construction of commercial portion and construction of residential portion, in the RREP which has time of supply on or before $31^{\text {st }}$ March,2019;
(b) Te shall be calculated asunder:
$\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{e}}=\mathrm{T}^{*} \mathrm{~F}_{1} * \mathrm{~F}_{2} * \mathrm{~F}_{3} * \mathrm{~F}_{4}$
Where, -

\% Completion of construction as on $31^{\text {st }}$ March, 2019

# I 

llustration: where one- fifth (twenty percent) of the construction has been completed, $\mathrm{F}_{4}$ shall be $100 \div 20=5$.

Explanation: "\% Completion of construction as on $31^{\text {st }}$ March, 2019" shall be the same as declared to the Real Estate Regulatory Authority in terms of section 4 and section 11 of Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 and where the same is not required to be declared to the Real Estate Regulatory Authority, it shall be got determined and certified by an architect registered with the Council of Architecture constituted under the Architects Act, 1972 (20 of 1972) or a chartered engineer registered with the Institution of Engineers (India).
(c) The amounts ' $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{x}}$ ' and ' $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{e}}$ ' shall be computed separately for input tax credit of central tax, State tax, Union territory tax and integratedtax.
(d) Where, $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{x}}$ is positive, i.e. $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{e}}<\mathrm{T}$, the registered person shall pay, by debit in the electronic credit ledger or electronic cash ledger, an amount equal to the difference between T and Te . Such a mount shall form part of the output tax liability of the registered person and the amount shall be furnished in FORM GST ITC-03.

Explanation: The registered person may file an application in FORM GST DRC- 20, seeking extension of time for the payment of taxes or any amount due or for allowing payment of such taxes or amount in installments in accordance with the provisions of section 80. The commissioner may issue an order in FORM GST DRC- 21 allowing the taxable person further time to make payment and/or to pay the amount in such monthly installments, not exceeding twenty-four, as he may deemfit.
(e) Where, $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{x}}$ is negative, i.e. $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{e}}>\mathrm{T}$, the registered person shall be eligible to take ITC on goods and services received on or after $1^{\text {st }}$ April, 2019 for construction of the RREP, for which he shall not otherwise be eligible, to the extent of difference between $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{e}}$ andT.
(f) Where percentage completion is zero but ITC has been availed on goods and services received for the project on or prior to $31^{\text {st }}$ March, 2019, input tax credit attributable toconstructionofresidentialandcommercial portionwhichhastimeofsupplyonorafter 1st April, 2019, shall be calculated and the amount equal to Tx shall be paid or taken credit of, as the case may be, as prescribed above, with the modification that percentage completion for calculation of F4 shall be taken as the percentage completion which, as certified by an architect registered with the Council of Architecture constituted under the Architects Act, 1972 ( 20 of 1972) or a chartered engineer registered with the Institution of Engineers (India), can be achieved with the input services received and inputs in stock as on 31st March, 2019.
2. Where \% completion as on 31st March, 2019 is zero but invoicing has been done having time of supply before 31st March, 2019, and no input services or inputs have been received as on 31st March, 2019, "T" shall be calculated as follows:-
(a) Input tax credit on inputs and input services attributable to construction of residential and commercial portion in an RREP, which has time of supply on or before $31^{\text {st }}$ March, 2019

may be denoted as $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{e}}$
which shall be calculated asunder,
$\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{e}}=\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{n}} * \mathrm{~F}_{\mathrm{i}} * \mathrm{~F}_{\mathrm{i}} * \mathrm{~F}_{\mathrm{i}} \mathrm{Where}$,
$\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{n}}=$ Tax paid on such inputs and input services on which ITC is available under the CGST Act, received in 2019-20 for construction of residential and commercial apartments in the RREP.
$\mathrm{F}_{1}, \mathrm{~F}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{F}_{3}$ shall be the same as in para 1 above
(b) The registered person shall be eligible to take ITC on goods and services received on or after $1^{\text {st }}$ April, 2019 for construction of residential or commercial portion in the RREP, for which he shall not otherwise be eligible, to the extent of the amount of $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{e}}$.
(c) The amount ' $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{e}}$ ' shall be computed separately for input tax credit of central tax, State tax, Union territory tax and integratedtax.
3. Notwithstanding anything contained in paragraph 1 or paragraph 2 above, $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{e}}$ shall be determined in the following situations asunder:
(i) where percentage invoicing is more than the percentage completion and the difference between percentage invoicing (per cent. points) and the percentage completion (per cent. points) of construction is more than 25 per cent. points; the value of percentage invoicing shall be deemed to be percentage completion plus 25 percent. points;
(ii) where the value of invoices issued on or prior to $31^{\text {st }}$ March, 2019 exceeds the consideration actually received on or prior to $31^{\text {st }}$ March, 2019 by more than 25 per cent. of consideration actually received; the value of such invoices for the purpose of determination of percentage invoicing shall be deemed to be actual consideration received plus 25 per cent. of the actual consideration received;and
(iii) where, the value of procurement of inputs and input services prior to 1st April, 2019 exceeds the value of actual consumption of the inputs and input services used in the percentage of construction completed as on 31st March, 2019 by more than 25 per cent. of value of actual consumption of inputs and input services, the jurisdictional commissioner or any other officer authorized in this regard may fix the Te based on actual per unit consumption of inputs and input services based on the documents duly certified by a chartered accountant or cost accountant submitted by the promoter in this regard, applying the accepted principles of accounting.

In this example, the promoter has procured 50 per cent. of goods and services from a GST registered person. However, he has procured sand, cement and aluminum windows, ply and commercial wood etc. from an unregistered supplier. Thus, value of goods and services procured from registered suppliers during a financial year falls short of threshold limit of 80 per cent. To fulfill his tax liability on the shortfall of 30 per cent. from mandatory purchase, the promoter has to pay GST on cement at the applicable rate on reverse charge basis. After payment of GST on cement, on the remaining shortfall of 15 per cent., the promoter shall pay tax @ 18 per cent. under RCM.
