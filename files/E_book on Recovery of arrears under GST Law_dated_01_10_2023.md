# 1.1 Background 

Disputes are common in any law, and tax law is no exception. Issuance of Demand notice, adjudication of notice, and recovery of demand confirmed are key processes in any case of tax dispute settlement. Tax dispute may arise between tax department and taxpayer due to various reasons such as difference in interpretation of legal provision, non-compliance of tax law due to ignorance of law, or intentional tax evasion by dis-honest or unscrupulous taxpayer etc.

### 1.2: Principles of Natural Justice-an Essence of Dispute Settlement Process

For demand of any tax amount from taxpayer which has not been paid, short paid, erroneously refunded or ITC wrongly availed or utilized, the tax officer is required to follow the principles of natural justice- first by informing the taxpayer the grounds which has resulted in demand of tax/interest or imposition of penalty by way of issuance of notice /statement; and second-by giving the taxpayer an opportunity to explain his side before any order is passed by the adjudicating authority. The order passed by the tax authority is required to be speaking or reasoned order-containing facts of the case, discussing relevant legal provisions and explaining the reasons of conclusion arrived at. Thus, to follow the principles of natural justice and issuance of speaking order, are the basic essential elements of any tax dispute settlement process.

### 1.3: Legal Provisions for Demand of Tax.

While Chapter XV of the CGST Act, 2017 deals with the subject of "demand and recovery of tax", the basic provisions for demand of taxes are contained in sections 73 to 77 of the CGST Act, 2017. Once the adjudication Order has been issued by the adjudicating authority, then amount of tax confirmed in the order along with interest and/or penalty imposed becomes due for recovery from the taxpayer. Sometimes, confirmed demand may also be in the form of fine, late fee etc. The recovery provisions under GST laws are contained in Sections 78 to 83 of the CGST Act, 2017. For learning more about the details of legal provisions and procedures for demand proceedings under the GST law, the module on "issuance of Demand Cum Show Notices" may be referred.

# 1.4: Difference between Demand and Recovery 

In case of dispute over payment of tax as per law by the taxpayer, GST laws envisages issuance of notice/statement. Any amount mentioned in the notice/ statement per se does not become recoverable on issuance of notice /statement. It is only the first step and is a formal communication to the taxpayer to pay tax or other amount mentioned in the notice/statement. Tax payer may agree or dis-agree with the tax amount mentioned and demanded in the notice or statement. If the taxpayer agrees and pays the tax amount/interest/penalty/late fee/fine etc., then dispute ends. However, if the tax payer does not agree with the demand of tax/interest/penalty/fine/ late fee etc. as mentioned in notice/statement, then the same need to be adjudicated by the competent adjudicating authority by passing speaking or reasoned order. After issuance of adjudication order, the demand confirmed become due for recovery from the noticee.

### 1.5: What is Arrear?

In the process of adjudication, the demand may be confirmed fully or partially or dropped. On confirmation of demand by way of issuance of Order after adjudication proceedings, it become arrears and thereby, become recoverable from the taxpayer. If it is paid by taxpayer, then the dispute culminate. However, in case, it is not paid by the taxpayer, then various tools prescribed in GST law has to be used to recover the same from taxpayer or other person concerned. Dues to be recovered may be in the form of Central Tax, State Tax, Integrated tax, Compensation Cess, Interest, Penalty, late fee or fine etc.

In other words, arrears are the overdue payment of the amount of tax, cess, interest, fine, late fee or penalty that is confirmed against a person who is liable to pay the same to the exchequer. It arises as a result of Order-in-Original, Order of Appellate authority, appellate Tribunal and the Courts of law (HC/SC).

### 1.6 What is not Arrear?

It may be kept in mind that in following situations, the amount do not qualify to be called "arrears":

- The amount involved in the case under process of investigation,

- Unconfirmed demands (i.e. Show Cause Notice, including those lying in Call Book),
- The Order-in-Original that has been set aside or remanded for de-novo adjudication by Appellate authority.


# 1.7 Categories of Arrears 

In the department, arrears are traditionally categorized in the following categories:
(i) Arrear in Litigation/Appeal: where the confirmed demand is under appeal or litigation before any appellate authorities, namely, Supreme Court/High Court/Appellate Tribunal /Commissioner (Appeals)
(ii) Restrained Arrear: Taxpayer against whom financial/operational creditors has initiated insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding before NCLT/DRT under Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (in Short IBC, 2016);
(iii) Arrear where appeal period is not yet over.
(iv) Recoverable arrear other than those covered from (i) to (iii) above.

### 1.8: Arrears under Litigation/Appeal

Under GST Law, any order passed against taxpayer or any other person by adjudicating authority can be challenged by the aggrieved person by way of filing appeal before the appellate authority. The GST law envisages four appellate authorities namely Appellate Authority, Appellate Tribunal, High Court and Supreme Court.

During the pendency of appeal of the taxpayer before any appellate authority, the amount confirmed by the adjudicating authority remained an arrear under litigation/appeal and recovery is governed by the provisions of the law. It becomes recoverable arrear if appeal period is over and no appeal has been filed by the taxpayer against adverse order passed by Adjudicating authority or any appellate authority.

The process of settlement of dispute and when arrears become restrained arrear or recoverable arrears has been explained in greater details in the following paragraphs.

If any demand proceedings have attained finality either on account of no appeal having been filed against OIO or on account of litigation process being finally over or attained finality on account of taxpayer having exhausted all appellate remedies available under law, then such confirmed demand becomes recoverable arrears and has to be recovered by taking recourse to the various tools provided in the GST law.

# 1.9: Issuance of Order in Original (OIO) by Adjudicating Authority. 

After issuance of notice/ statement under Section 73 or section 74, as the case may be, the same is required to be adjudicated by passing speaking order after following the principles of natural justice. In case, the tax demand is confirmed by the Adjudicating authority, then the taxpayer, who is aggrieved by the Order passed by the Adjudicating authority has right to appeal before the appellate authority under Section 107 of the CGST Act, 2017.

The term "Appellate Authority" has been defined under section 2(8) of the CGST Act, 2017 and it means an authority appointed or authorised to hear appeals as referred to in section 107 .

Vide notification No. 2/2017-Central Tax, dated 19.06.2017 (w.e.f. 01.072017), the Central Government has appointed or authorised the Commissioner (Appeals) and Additional/Joint Commissioner (appeals) before whom the appeal shall lie under section 107 of the CGST Act, 2017. Similar notifications/orders have been issued by each of the State Government /Union Territory under respective State GST Act, 2017.

### 1.10: Appeal against OIO before Appellate Authority

It may be noted here that both Department as well as taxpayer (including any other person aggrieved by OIO) has right to make appeal before Appellate Authority.

# 1.11: No Appeal before Appellate Authority without Pre-deposit 

As per provisions of section 107(6), no appeal shall be filed before Appellate authority under sub-section 107 (1), unless the appellant has paid-

(b) a sum equal to ten per cent. of the remaining amount of tax in dispute arising from the said order subject to a maximum of twenty-five crore rupees, in relation to which the appeal has been filed.
[ Note: The ceiling of Rs. 25 crores for filing appeal before Appellate Authority have been incorporated in the CGST Act, 2017 vide section 25 of the CGST (Amendment) Act, 2018 (No. 31 of 2018) w.e.f. 01.02.2019]

### 1.12: Deemed Stay against recovery of Balance Amount (on filing appeal with pre-deposit).

As per provision of sub-section (7) of Section 107, where the appellant has paid the amount under section 107(6), the recovery proceedings for the balance amount shall be deemed to be stayed.

### 1.13: Appeal Against Order in Appeal (OIA) before Appellate Tribunal

If any person or department is aggrieved by the Order passed by the Appellate Authority, then it have right to make further appeal to Appellate Tribunal under Section 112 of the CGST Act, 2017.

As per section 112(1) of the CGST Act, 2017, any person aggrieved by an order passed against him under section 107 or section 108 of the CGST Act or the SGST Act or the UTGST Act may file an appeal before the Appellate Tribunal against such order within three months from the date on which the order sought

to be appealed against is communicated to the person preferring the appeal. In terms of provision of section 112(4), the authorised officer, on behalf of department, can make any application to the Appellate Tribunal on the direction issued to him under provision of section 112(3).

# 1.14: No appeal before Appellate Tribunal without Pre-deposit 

As per provision of section 112(8) of the CGST Act, 2017, no appeal shall be filed before Appellate Tribunal unless the appellant has paid-

It may be noted that presently, the Government has decided to set up GST Tribunals vide notification SO 4073(E), dated 14.09.2023 issued by the Department of Revenue in the Ministry of Finance. The Tribunals are likely to be fully in place soon. Till such time, an option to file appeal before Tribunal against the order passed by the Appellate Authority is not available to the Tax payer or the department.

It may be noted that vide Circular No. 132/2/2020-GST, dated 18.03.2020, issued under section 168 (1) of the CGST Act, 2017, the Government has issued Clarification in respect of appeal in regard to non-constitution of Appellate Tribunal.
" The appellate tribunal has not been constituted in view of the order by Madras High Court in case of Revenue Bar Assn. v. Union of India and

therefore the appeal cannot be filed within three months from the date on which the order sought to be appealed against is communicated. In order to remove difficulty arising in giving effect to the above provision of the Act, the Government, on the recommendations of the Council, has issued the Central Goods and Services Tax (Ninth Removal of Difficulties) Order, 2019 dated 03.12.2019. It has been provided through the said Order that the appeal to tribunal can be made within three months (six months in case of appeals by the Government) from the date of communication of order or date on which the President or the State President, as the case may be, of the Appellate Tribunal enters office, whichever is later.

Hence, as of now, the prescribed time limit to make application to appellate tribunal will be counted from the date on which President or the State President enters office. The appellate authority while passing order may mention in the preamble that appeal may be made to the appellate tribunal whenever it is constituted within three months from the President or the State President enters office. Accordingly, it is advised that the appellate authorities may dispose all pending appeals expeditiously without waiting for the constitution of the appellate tribunal."

# 1.15: Deemed Stay against Recovery of Balance Amount (in case of appeal before GST Tribunal with pre-deposit). 

As per provision of section 112(9) of the CGST Act, 2017, where the appellant has paid the amount as per sub-section 112(8) while filing appeal before Appellate Tribunal, the recovery proceedings for the balance amount shall be deemed to be stayed till the disposal of the appeal.

### 1.16: Appeal before High Court and Supreme Court.

In the GST law, provision has been incorporated where appeal against the Order passed by the Appellate Tribunal can be filed before Hon'ble High Court under section 117(1) of the CGST Act, 2017 if the case involves substantial question of law. Similarly, against Order passed by the High Court, Appeal can be filed before Hon'ble Supreme Court under section 118 of the CGST Act, 2017.

### 1.17: Sum due to be paid fully in case of appeal before High Court/Supreme Court.

As per section 119 of the CGST Act, 2017, notwithstanding that an appeal has been preferred to the High Court or the Supreme Court, sums due to the Government as a result of an order passed by the National or Regional Benches of the Appellate Tribunal under sub-section (1) of section 113 or an order passed by the State Bench or Area Benches of the Appellate Tribunal under sub-section (1) of section 113 or an order passed by the High Court under section 117, as the case may be, shall be payable in accordance with the order so passed.

# 1.18: Restrained arrears: Recovery of Arrear in case of Initiation of Insolvency or Bankruptcy proceedings before NCLT under Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC, 2016) 

There could also be cases where proceedings have been initiated by financial or operational creditors against the taxpayer or defaulter person from whom GST arrears are also due for recovery, in case of companies before National Company Law Tribunal or in case of individual or partnership firms before Debt recovery Tribunal (DRT) under Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016.

As soon as the case is admitted before NCLT/DRT, the provision of IBC Code, 2016 becomes applicable. The provision of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code has overriding effect over the provision of GST Laws. In case of conflict between the provision of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code and CGST Act, 2017, the provision of former will prevail. Therefore, any action for recovery, where the proceedings have already been initiated by financial /operational creditors against the defaulter before NCLT, has to be considered in the light of provision of IBC, 2016.

In this regard, CBIC has also issued two Circular bearing No. 134/04/2020GST dated 23rd March, 2020 and Circular No. 187/19/2022-GST, dated 27.12.2022. For clarity, these Circulars may also be carefully studied.

Vide Circular No.134/04/2020-GST dated 23rd March, 2020, it has been clarified that no coercive action can be taken against the corporate debtor with respect to the dues of the period prior to the commencement of Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP). Such dues will be treated as 'operational debt' and the claims may be filed by the proper officer before the NCLT in accordance with the provisions of the IBC.

The CBIC also examined the issue of the modalities for implementation of the order of the adjudicating authority under Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (hereinafter referred to as the "IBC") with respect to demand for recovery against such corporate debtor under Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 (hereinafter referred to as "CGST Act") as well under the existing laws and the treatment of such statutory dues under CGST Act and existing laws, after finalization of the proceedings under IBC. While clarifying this question, the CBIC vide Circular No. 187/19/2022-GST, dated 27.12.2022 clarified as under:-

As per Section 84 of CGST Act, if the government dues against any person under CGST Act are reduced as a result of any appeal, revision or other proceedings in respect of such government dues, then an intimation for such reduction of government dues has to be given by the Commissioner to such person and to the appropriate authority with whom the recovery proceedings are pending. Further, recovery proceedings can be continued in relation to such reduced amount of government dues.

The word 'other proceedings' is not defined in CGST Act. It is to be mentioned that the adjudicating authorities and appellate authorities under IBC are quasi-judicial authorities constituted to deal with civil disputes pertaining to insolvency and bankruptcy. For instance, under IBC, NCLT serves as an adjudicating authority for insolvency proceedings which are initiated on application from any stakeholder of the entity like the firm, creditors, debtors, employees etc. and passes an order approving the resolution plan. As the proceedings conducted under IBC also adjudicate the government dues pending under the CGST Act or under existing laws against the corporate debtor, the same appear to be covered under the term 'other proceedings' in Section 84 of CGST Act.

Rule 161 of Central Goods and Services Tax Rules, 2017 prescribes FORM GST DRC-25 for issuing intimation for such reduction of demand specified under section 84 of CGST Act. Accordingly, in cases where a confirmed demand for recovery has been issued by the tax authorities for which a summary has been issued in FORM GST DRC-07/DRC 07A against the corporate debtor, and where the proceedings have been finalised against the corporate debtor under IBC reducing the amount of statutory dues payable by the corporate debtor to the government under CGST Act or under existing laws, the jurisdictional Commissioner shall issue an intimation in FORM GST DRC-25 reducing such

demand, to the taxable person or any other person as well as the appropriate authority with whom recovery proceedings are pending. 6 . It is requested that suit

To know the course of action to be taken in cases where liquidation proceedings are in progress before NCLT, the e-learning module on NCLT/IBC may be referred to.

### 2.4: Recovery Provisions in the GST (Compensation to States) Act, 2017

For recovery to dues under GST (compensation to States) Act, 2017, section 11 of the GST (Compensation to States) Act, 2017 provides for applicability of the provision of CGST, 2017 to intra-state supplies and for applicability of the provision of IGST Act, 2017 to inter-state supplies.

The section 11 (1) of the GST (Compensation to States) Act, 2017 provides that the provisions of the CGST Act, and the rules made thereunder, including those relating to assessment, input tax credit, non-levy, short-levy, interest, appeals, offences and penalties, shall, as far as may be, mutatis mutandis, apply, in relation to the levy and collection of the cess leviable under section 8 on the intra-State supply of goods and services, as they apply in relation to the levy and collection of central tax on such intra-State supplies under the said Act or the rules made thereunder.

# 2.7: Hierarchical Approach Not to be followed while applying various modes of recovery 

The GST law provides for several modes of recovery of dues. Each method of recovery has its' advantage and dis-advantages over others. A decision to apply one or more mode of recovery has to be taken by the proper officer after carefully examining the facts of the case and option available before him. There is no requirement to apply the various mode of recovery in sequential manner or any particular manner.

### 2.8: Proper Officer in respect of Recovery of GST arrears

In the GST law, the term "proper officer" is frequently used. Therefore, it is essential to know what this term means? and officer of which rank is empowered to take action under that legal provision. The Proper officer may be of different rank under different provisions of the CGST Act, 2017 or the CGST Rules, 2017

As per definition provided under clause (91) of section 2 of the CGST Act, 2017, the "proper officer" in relation to any function to be performed under the CGST Act, means the Commissioner or the officer of the central tax who is assigned that function by the Commissioner in the Board. Accordingly, the Commissioner in the Board has issued Circular No. 3/3/2017-GST, dated 05.07.2017 which has been subsequently amended vide Circular No. 31/05/2018-GST, dated 09.02.2018 and again vide Circular No. 169/01/2022-GST, dated 12.03.2022.

As per the Circulars issued by the Board, in respect of recovery of tax or other dues, the officers of different ranks have been assigned function of proper officer under Sections 77 to 84 of the CGST Act, 2017 and Rules 142 to 161 of the CGST Rules, 2017, as per details given in Table I below:-

During the litigation process by way of appeal or revision against the Order-inOriginal, the dues remain restrained arrears as each stage of appeal prescribe predeposit of disputed confirmed demands and on deposit of specified portion of disputed tax amount, the order is deemed to be stayed.

3.3.6: Self Assessed Tax and Recovery thereof (Ref: Section 75 (12) of the CGSTAct).

Where any amount of self-assessed tax in accordance with the return furnished under section 39 ( which deals with furnishing of returns) remains unpaid either wholly or partly or any amount of interest payable on such tax remains unpaid, then not withstanding any provisions contained in section 73 or 74, the same is required to recovered under section 79 of the CGST Act, 2017.

Further, the term "self-assessed tax' include the tax payable in respect of outward supplies furnished under section 37 (as per GSTR-1), but not included in the return furnished under section 39 ( i.e. GSTR-3B) [ Ref: explanation in section 75(12) inserted with effect from 1.1.2022 and Instruction No. 01/2022GST, dated 07.01.2022).

The Instruction No. 01/2022- GST, dated 07.01.2022 lays down guidelines for recovery proceedings under the provisions of section 79 of the CGST Act, 2017 in cases covered under explanation to sub-section (12) of section 75 of the CGST Act, 2017

# 3.3.7: Procedure to be adopted in cases of self-assessed tax not paid before initiating action under Section 79 (Ref: Instruction No. 1/2022-GST, dated 7.1.2022) 

As per provision of section 75(12) of the CGST Act, 2017, where the tax payable in respect of details of outward supplies furnished by the registered person in GSTR-I, has not been paid through GSTR-3B return, either wholly or partly, or any amount of interest payable on such tax remains unpaid, then in such cases, the tax short paid on such self-assessed and thus self-admitted liability and the interest thereon are liable to be recovered under the provisions of section 79.

## Step 1: To Rule out cases of genuine difference b/w GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B

(a) Case of typographical error or wrong reported due to mistake: There may, however, be some cases where there may be a genuine reason for difference between the details of outward supplies declared in GSTR-1 and those declared in GSTR-3B. For example, the person may have made a typographical error or may have wrongly reported any detail in GSTR-I or GSTR-3B. Such errors or omissions can be rectified by the said person in a subsequent GSTR-I/ GSTR-3B as per the provisions of sub-section (3) of section 37 or the provisions of sub-section (9) of section 39, as the case may be.
(b) Outward Supply not declared in the past, but tax paid under GSTR-3B and outward supplies being reported in later tax period: There may also be cases, where a supply could not be declared by the registered person in GSTR-I of an earlier tax period, though the tax on the same was paid by correctly reporting the said supply in GSTR-3B. The details of such supply may now be reported by the registered person in the GSTR-I of the current tax period. In such cases, there could be a mis-match between GSTR-1and GSTR-3B (liability reported in GSTR-I> tax paid in GSTR-3B) in the current tax period.

Therefore, in all such cases, an opportunity needs to be provided to the concerned registered person to explain the differences between GSTR-I and GSTR-3B, if any, and for short payment or non-payment of the amount of self-assessed tax liability, and interest thereon, before any action under section 79 of the Act is taken for recovery of the said amount.

# Step 2: To send communication to the Registered person asking him to pay or to explain the reasons of short payment or non-payment 

Accordingly, where ever any such amount of tax, self-assessed by the registered person in his outward supply statement GSTR-I is found to be short paid or not paid by the said person through his GSTR-3B return in terms of the provisions of sub-section (12) of section 75 of the Act, the proper officer may send a communication (with DIN, in terms of guidelines issued vide circular No. 122/41/2019-GST dated 5th November 2019) to the registered person to pay the amount short paid or not paid, or to explain the reasons for such short payment or non-payment of self-assessed tax, within a reasonable time, as prescribed in the communication. If, the concerned person is able to justify the differences between GSTR-I and GSTR-3B, or is able to explain the reasons of such short-payment or non-payment of tax, to the satisfaction of the proper officer, or pays the amount such short paid or not paid, then there may not be any requirement to initiate proceedings for recovery under section 79 .

## Step 3: Proceeding under section 79 to be started if there is no response or no payment of short paid amount

If the said registered person either fails to reply to the proper officer, or fails to make the payment of such amount short paid or not paid, within the time prescribed in the communication or such further period as may be permitted by the proper officer, then the proceedings for recovery of the said amount as per provisions of section 79 may be initiated by the proper officer. Further, where the said registered person fails to explain the reasons for such difference/ short payment of tax to the satisfaction of the proper officer, then the proper officer may proceed for recovery of the said amount as per provisions of section 79.

Vide Instructions No. CBEC-20/16/05/2021-GST/359, dated 23.02.2021, the board has prescribed Guidelines for provisional attachment of Property under section 83 of the CGST Act, 2017. The relevant ingredient of the instruction issued by the Board has been explained in following sub-paragraphs.

### 5.6.1: Grounds for Attachment of Property

(1) There must be pendency of a proceeding against a taxable person under sections mentioned in Section 83 of the Act.
(2) The Commissioner must have formed the opinion that provisional attachment of the property belonging to the taxable person is necessary for the purpose of protecting the interest of the Government Revenue

For forming an opinion under section 83, it is important that Commissioner must exercise due diligence and carefully examine all the facts of the case,

including the nature of offence, amount of revenue involved, establish nature of business and extent of investment in capital assets and reasons to believe that the taxable person against whom the proceedings referred in section 83 are pending, may dispose of or the remove the property if not attached provisionally.

The basis, on which Commissioner has found such an opinion should be duly recorded on file.

Board has advised officer that the power of provisional attachment must not be exercised in a routine/mechanical manner and careful examination of all the facts of the case is important to determine whether the case(s) is fit for exercising power under section 83. The collective evidence, based on the proceedings/enquiry conducted in the case, must indicate that the prima-facie a case has been made out against the taxpayer, before going ahead with any provisional attachment. The remedy of attachment being, by its very nature, extraordinary has to be resorted to without utmost circumspection and with maximum care and caution.

# 5.6.2: Procedure for Provisional Attachment of Property 

The Board has laid down the following Procedure for provisional Attachment of Property:-
(1)In case, the commissioner forms an opinion to attach any property, including bank account, of the taxable person in terms of section 83, he should duly record on file the basis on which he has formed such an opinion. He should, thereafter, pass an order in FORM GST DRC-22 with proper document identification number (DIN) mentioning therein the details of property being attached.
(2) A copy of the order of attachment should be sent to the concerned Revenue authority or Transport Authority or Bank or the relevant authority to place encumbrance on the said movable or immovable property. The property, thus attached, shall be removed only on the written instructions from the commissioner.

(3) A copy of such attachment order should be provided to the said taxable person as early as possible so that objections, if any, to the said attachment can be made by the taxable person within the time frame prescribed under rule 159 of the CGST Rules. If such objection is filed by the taxable person, Commissioner should provide an opportunity of being heard to the person filing the objection.
(4) After considering the fact presented by the person in his written objections as well as during a personal hearing, if any, the Commissioner should form a reasoned view whether the property is still required to be continued to be attached or not and pass an order in writing to this effect. In case, the commissioner is satisfied that the property was or is no longer liable for attachment, he may release his property by issuing order in FORM GST DRC 23.
(5) Even in cases where objection is not filed within the time prescribed under rule 159(5) of CGST rules the Commissioner may take the grounds mentioned in the said objection/representation on record and pass a reasoned order. Where the Commissioner is satisfied that property was or is no longer liable for attachment, he may release such property by issuing an order in FORM GST DRC-23.
(6) Each such provisional attachment shall cease to have effect after the expiry of a period of one year from the date of order of attachment.

# 5.6.3: Provisional Attachment of Properties of Perishable/Hazardous Nature 

If the provisionally attached properties of perishable/ hazardous nature, then such property shall be released to the taxable person by issuing order in FORM GST DRC-23, after taxable person pays an amount equivalent to the market price of such property or the amount that is or may become payable by the taxable person, whichever is lower and submits proof of payment.

In case the taxable person fails to pay the said amount, then the said property of perishable or hazardous nature may be disposed of and the amount recovered from such disposal of property shall be adjustable against the tax,

interest, penalty, fee or any other amount payable by the taxable person. Further, the sale proceeds thus obtained must be deposited with the nearest government treasury or Branch of any nationalized bank in fixed deposit and the receipt thereof must be retained for record, so that same can be adjusted against the amount determined to be recoverable from the said taxable person.

# 5.6.4 Cases fit for provisional attachment of property 

As the remedy of attachment being, by its very nature, extraordinary, needs to be resorted to with utmost circumspection and with maximum care and caution. It normally should not be invoked in cases of technical nature and should be resorted to mainly in cases where there is an evasion of tax or where wrongful input tax credit is availed or utilized or wrongfully passed on. While the specific facts of the case need to be examined in detail before forming an opinion in the matter, the following are some of type of cases, where provisional attachment can be considered to be resorted to, subject to specific facts of the case:
Where taxable person has:
a. supplied any goods or services or both without issue of any invoice, in violation of the provisions of the Act or the rules made there under, with an intention to evade tax; or
b. issued any invoice or bill without supply of goods or services or both in violation of the provisions of the Act, or the rules made there under; or
c. availed input tax credit using the invoice or bill referred to in clause (b) or fraudulently availed input tax credit without any invoice or bill; or
d. collected any amount as tax but has failed to pay the same to the Government beyond a period of three months from the date of which such payment becomes due; or
e. fraudulently obtained refund; or
f. passed of input tax credit fraudulently to the recipients but has not paid the commensurate tax

The above list is illustrative only and not exhaustive. The Commissioner, may examine the specific facts of the case and take a reasoned view in the matter.

### 5.6.5: Types of property that can be attached

The Board has issued following directions in this regard.

(a) As per Board directions, it should be ensured that the value of property attached provisionally is not excessive. The provisional attachment of property shall be to the extent it is required to protect the interest of revenue, that is to say, the value of attached property should be as near as possible to the estimated amount of pending revenue against such person.
(b) More than one property may be attached in case value of one property is not sufficient to cover the estimated amount of pending revenue against such person. Further, different properties of the taxpayer can be attached at different points of time subject to the conditions specified in section 83 of the Act.
(c) the provisional attachment can be made only of the property belonging to the taxable person, against whom the proceedings mentioned under section 83 of the Act are pending.
(d) Movable property should normally be attached only if the immovable property, available for attachment, is not sufficient to protect the interests of revenue.
(e) As far as possible, it should also be ensured that such attachment does not hamper normal business activities of the taxable person. This would mean that raw materials and inputs required for production of finished goods should not normally be attached by the Department.
(f) In cases where the movable property, including bank account, belonging to taxable person has been attached, such movable property may be released if taxable person offers, in lieu of movable property, any other immovable property which is sufficient to protect the interest of revenue. Such immovable property should be of value not less than the tax amount in dispute. It should also be free from any subsisting charge, liens, mortgages or encumbrances, property tax fully paid up to date and not involved in any legal dispute. The taxable person must produce the original title needs and other necessary information relating to the property, for the satisfaction of the concerned officer.

# 5.6.6 Attachment Period

Every provisional attachment shall cease to have effect after the expiry of a period of one year from the date of the provisional attachment order. Besides the provisional attachment order shall also cease to have effect if an order in FORM GST DRC-23 for release of such property is made by the Commissioner.

# 5.6.7: Timely Completion of Investigation and Adjudication 

As the provisional attachment of property is resorted to protect the interests of the revenue and may also affect the working capital of the taxable person, it may be endeavored that in all such cases, the investigation and adjudication are completed at the earliest, well within the period of attachment, so that the due liability of tax as well as interest, penalty etc. arising upon adjudication can be recovered from the said taxable person and the purpose of attachment is achieved.

### 5.6.8: Provisional Attachment in case where the concerned person has Share in property

Where the property to be provisionally attached consists of the share or interest of the concerned taxable person in property belonging to him and another as co-owners, the provisional attachment shall be made by order to the concerned person prohibiting him from transferring the share or interest or charging it in any way.

### 5.6.9: Property exempt from attachment

All such property as is by the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), exempted from attachment and sale for execution of a Decree of a Civil Court shall be exempt from provisional attachment
