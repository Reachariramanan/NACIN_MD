## Amendments made in the Constitution in context of GST

Moreover, the GST was to subsume the plethora of existing taxes and duties levied by both the Central Government and State Governments, therefore, the amendment were also required in the State List and Union List contained in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution.

Further, the deeming provision has been made to treat import of supply of goods or services as supply of goods or services deemed to have been made in the course of inter-state trade or commerce. Exercising the powers under Article 269A of the Constitution, the Parliament has enacted the IGST Act, 2017 to levy and collect IGST on inter-state supply of goods or supply of services.
4.1 The text of Article 269A inserted in the Constitution vide the Constitution (101st Amendment) Act, 2016 is as under:-

Accordingly, the enabling legal provisions have been incorporated in section 3 of the Customs Tariff Act, 1975 by inserting sub-section (7) and sub-section (9), thereby providing levy of IGST and GST Compensation Cess respectively on imported goods with effect from 1.7.2017. These amendments have been made in the Customs Tariff Act, 1975 vide the Taxation Laws (Amendment) Act, 2017 (18 of 2017).
12.1 These relevant provisions incorporated in section 3 of the Customs Tariff Act, 1975 providing levy of IGST on import goods are as under:-
"(7) Any article which is imported into India shall, in addition, be liable to integrated tax at such rate, not exceeding forty per cent. as is leviable under section 5 of the Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 on a like article on its supply in India, on the value of the imported article as determined under sub-section (8).
(8) For the purposes of calculating the integrated tax under sub-section (7) on any imported article where such tax is leviable at any percentage of its value, the value of the imported article shall, notwithstanding anything contained in section 14 of the Customs Act, 1962, be the aggregate of-
(a) the value of the imported article determined under sub-section (1) of section 14 of the Customs Act, 1962 or the tariff value of such article fixed under sub-section (2) of that section, as the case may be; and
(b) any duty of customs chargeable on that article under section 12 of the Customs Act, 1962, and any sum chargeable on that article under any law for the time being in force as an addition to, and in the same manner as, a duty of customs, but does not include the tax referred to in sub-section (7) or the cess referred to in sub-section (9).
12.2 The relevant provisions incorporated in section 3 of the Customs Tariff Act, 1975 providing for levy of GST Compensation Cess on import goods are as under:-

(10) For the purposes of calculating the goods and services tax compensation cess under sub-section (9) on any imported article where such cess is leviable at any percentage of its value, the value of the imported article shall, notwithstanding anything contained in section 14 of the Customs Act, 1962, be the aggregate of-

(b) any duty of customs chargeable on that article under section 12 of the Customs Act, 1962, and any sum chargeable on that article under any law for the time being in force as an addition to, and in the same manner as, a duty of customs, but does not include the tax referred to in sub-section (7) or the cess referred to in sub-section (9)."

13 Under the IGST Act, 2017, the import of services or import of goods has been made liable for payment of IGST. While the requisite legal provisions allowing levy and collection of IGST and GST Compensation Cess on imported goods have been made in Section 3 of the Customs Tariff Act, 1975, in case of import of services, the legal provisions are contained in the IGST Act, 2017. In such cases of import of services, the recipient of service is required to discharge the tax liability.
