# Understanding GST: Through 7x 7- Steps/Filter Approach 

## Introduction:

With Goods and Services Tax (GST) system of taxation in place, following key questions arise in the mind of any person who is planning to start any new business involving either supplies of goods or services or both:-
(i) Whether he is liable to pay GST at all?
(ii) If yes, which tax should he pay i.e. (CGST + SGST/UTGST) or (IGST), and how much tax should he pay? Is he liable to pay Cess also [Under GST (Compensation to State) Act, 2017) ?.
(iii) What point of time should he pay GST to the Government?
(iv) Other vital procedure related questions:-

- Classes of taxable person under which one need to register-one or more than one? One or multiple registration?
- Types and frequency of returns to be filed- i.e. which return (s) is to be filed by him and when? What is the information to be furnished in different returns? What will happen if he does not file return or file it late?
- How much Input Tax Credit is eligible to him on inputs, capital goods and input services? Is there anything on which input tax credit is not admissible to him? What happens to credit lying in his account or when he is switching over from exempted/non-taxable/composition category to taxable category or vice versa?
- What are timelines prescribed for filing return, payment of taxes etc? What are the consequences of failing to comply with time lines prescribed in the law for various processes?
- What are compliance requirement and what if he fails to comply with such statutory provisions?
- Whether any refund is available to taxable person? If yes, then how much, when \& how?
- What is the mechanism envisaged in the law for resolution of tax disputes?
- Whether there are any penalty/ fine/fees/interest prescribed in the GST law for dealing with situations of non-compliance? If yes, what are the penalties/fee/interest/fine prescribed under law in different situations of noncompliance?

2. Through the $7 \times 7$ Step approach as explained below, an attempt has been made to answer the above said questions in a logical and sequential manner. If answer is negative in first two filters/steps, then one is not required to take GST registration. If answer is yes, then one should continue going through the remaining steps to determine his tax liability on every supply of goods/ services made by him.

# 3.1 Part A: 7 Steps Substantive Filter Approach to Determine Liability to Pay GST and to Determine the Amount of Tax Payable on any Supply 

Step 1: Supply filter [see whether activity done by any person falls within the scope of term "Supply" as defined under Section 7 of CGST Act, 2017 read with activities listed in the Schedule-I (activities which are deemed to be taxable supplies even when there is no consideration) and Schedule-III (activities which are neither considered supply of good nor supply of Services]

## Key Points to Note

Three important considerations for any activity to be a "supply":

- Whether activity can be considered as supply of goods or supply of services;
- Whether for consideration
- Whether in the course of business or furtherance of business
[If any one or more of the above said elements is absent, then activity is not covered within the meaning of the term "supply"]
[Note: If any activity being done by any personfalls within the scope of term "supply" then move to Step-2.]


## Step 2: Taxable Supply Filter

[see whether any/all of the supplies falls in category of non-taxable supply, Nil rated supply (chargeable to Nil rate of tax) or exempted supply i.e. supply fully exempted from payment of tax)];

## Key points to Note

- If all supplies made by a person falls in non-taxable supply or exempted supply/nil rated supply or there is no import of supply/ no liability to pay tax on reverse charge/ no liability for deduction of TDS/TCS, then there is no need for him to register for GST purpose.
- Under Section 23 (1) (b) of the CGST Act, 2017, the Government has specified an agriculturist as person not liable for registration, only to the extent of supply of produce out of cultivation of land.

## Page 3

- Government also has right to specify category of person who may be exempted from obtaining registration [Ref:Section 23(2) of the CGSG Act, 2017]
- In any supply being made by a person is a taxable supply of goods and his aggregate turnover is over 40 lakhs [in other than special category states] or 20 lakhs [in special category states], then such supplier of goods needs to register under GST and discharge tax liability as per GST law.
- In any supply being made by a person is a taxable supply of Services and his aggregate turnover is over 20 lakhs [in other than special category states] or 10 lakhs [in special category states], then such supplier of Services needs to register under GST and discharge tax liability as per GST law.
- Also see the 24 of the CGST Act, 2017 providing compulsory registration in certain cases irrespective of aggregate turnover being less that limit mentioned above.

Filter 2A: Reverse Charge Filter [see whether any of the goods/services being received are liable for payment on reverse charge basis under Section 9(3) of CGST Act, 2017].
Filter 2B: TDS Filter [see whether the person is required to deduct tax at source before making payment for services received under Section 51 of the CGST Act, 2017]
Filter 2C: TCS Filer [see whether the person is required to collect tax at source under Section 52 of the CGST Act, 2017

# Filter 3: Intra-state or Inter-state supplies filter 

[see whether in a particular supply, location of supplier and place of supply is located within the same state/UT or are in different state/UTs]

## Key Points to note

- Rule for determining "Place of supply" are contained in the IGST Act, 2017.
- If location of supplier and place of supply are within the same State/UTs, then supplier should pay CGST+ SGST.
- If location of supplier and place of supply are in different states/UTs, then supplier should pay IGST.
- Notwithstanding above, there are certain supplies which are to be considered as Inter-state supplies i.e. import of goods (till crossing of customs frontiers)/services, sale to tourist (as defined under section 15 of IGST Act,2017), supplies made to/or by SEZ unit/ Developer, OIDAR services; and thus, require payment of IGST.


## Legal Provisions to be referred

- Definition contained in Section 2(10) of IGST Act: Import of Goods; Section 2(11) of the IGST Act: Import of Services; Section 2(15) of the IGST Act: Location

## Page 4

of Supplier of Services; and Section 2(71) of the CGST Act, 2017: Location of supplier of Services.

- Section 7, 8, and 9 of the IGST Act, 2017 dealing with determination of nature of supply;
- Section 10, 11, and 12 of the IGST Act, 2017 dealing with place of supply of goods or services or both.

Filter 4: Goods or services filter [see whether supply under consideration is "supply of goods" or "supply of services"]

- Consider definition of "goods" (clause (52) of section 2) or "services" (clause(102) of Section 2) under the CGST Act, 2017
- Also consider supplies which are to be treated only as "supply of goods" or "supply of services" as specified in Schedule II of the CGST Act, 2017.

Filter 5: Rates of GST filter [see the classification of Goods or services being supplied and rate of GST applicable on goods/services being supplied]

# Key Points to Note 

- Consider rate of schedule for goods as specified by the Government under Section 9 the of CGST Act, 2017 read with corresponding provision of State GST Act [based on Harmonized system of Nomenclature (HSN)]
- Consider rate of GST on services as specified by Government under Schedule of Service Accounting code ( SAC) under Section 9 the of CGST Act, 2017 read with corresponding provision of State GST Act.
- In case of supply of goods specified in GST (Compensation to States) Act, 2017, also consider the rate of Compensation cess required to be paid at the rate specified in the Act.

Step 6: Value of supply filter [see on what value of supply, the GST is payable. As the GST is leviable on ad valorem basis i.e. specified percentage of taxable value, one need to determine the value of supply on which tax is payable]

## Key Points to Note

- For GST, Transaction value approach has been adopted.
- Transaction value is price actually paid or payable for the supply of goods or services, where the supplier and recipient are not related and the price is the sole consideration for the supply ( Ref: Section 15 of the CGST Act, 2017)
- Know as to what charges are includable in the value of supply? and what is the position in respect of various types of discounts given by supplier to the recipient?
- Relevant legal provisions are contained in Section 15 of the CGST Act, 2017 and Rule 27 to 35 of the CGST Rules, 2017; and Rule 31A and 32A of

## Page 5

the CGST Rules, 2017 for determining the value of supply in case of lottery, betting, gambling ,horse racing and online gaming.

Step 7: Time of supply [see at what point of transaction, Tax payer is liable to pay tax to the Government -whether date of receipt of goods, date of receipt of payment in the books of account; date of issue of invoice, date of provision of service etc.]

- Consider legal provisions regarding "Time of supply of goods" and "Time of supply of services" contained in Section 12 and 13 of the CGST Act, 2017 respectively along with relevant definitions in Section 2 of the CGST Act, 2017 and Section 2 of the IGST Act, 2017.


# 3.2 Part B: 7-Steps-Procedural filters: 

Step- 1. Registration filter: (Identify the number of registrations (one or more, depending on the business operations and its spread across States/UTs) and category/ Type of registration to be obtained under the GST law).

## Key Points to Note:

- Obtain separate registration for SEZ Unit/SEZ Developer if the taxable person also has SEZ Unit or being SEZ developer.
- If several establishments within a state, taxable person allowed to obtain separate registration for each business vertical within the same state or one registration for entire State/UT.
- They are several classes of taxable person such as Taxable person, Casual taxable person/Nonresident taxable person/TDS/TCS/Input Service Distributor/Composition taxable Person/ OIDAR Services. Identify which one is applicable to the taxable person.
