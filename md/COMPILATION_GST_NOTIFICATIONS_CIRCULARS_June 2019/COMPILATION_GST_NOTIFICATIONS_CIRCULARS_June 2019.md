# PREFACE

The introduction of GST in India has been a journey in which the Government and the Society have put their steps together. After the launch of GST on July, 012017 the Govt. has kept itself open for changes in GST for the benefit of society. Govt. has welcomed suggestion from ingenious experts in Taxation as well as from general public.

The Government has proposed multiple amendments to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) laws with the passage of time. Amendments have been made in Central GST, State GST, Integrated GST and Compensation of Sates Act.

The amendments have been announced through Notifications in CGST, CGST Rate, IGST, IGST Rate etc. Clarifications have also been provided by the Government on various issues through Circulars. We, being the eminent part of this journey have also marked a point by bringing materials and journals on GST, extending Certificate Course on GST and Advanced Certificate Course on GST on PAN India. Organizing Seminars and Workshops on GST, launching GST Helpdesk etc.

This material is a compilation of GST Notifications and Circulars from 1st July, 2017 to 31st May 2019. The main aim of this compilation is to act as a ready reckoner and help professionals in discharging their professional duties.

In the case of printing of books, pamphlets, brochures, annual reports, and the like, where only content is supplied by the publisher or the person who owns the usage rights to the intangible inputs while the physical inputs including paper used for printing belong to the printer, supply of printing is the principal supply and therefore such supplies would constitute supply of service falling under heading 9989 of the scheme of classification of services.
In case of supply of printed envelopes, letter cards, printed boxes, tissues, napkins, wall paper etc. falling under Chapter 48 or 49, printed with design, logo etc. supplied by the recipient of goods but made using physical inputs including paper belonging to the printer, predominant supply is that of goods.

## Circular No. 12/12/2017-GST

## Dated: 26.10.2017

Sub: Clarification regarding applicability of GST on the superior kerosene oil [SKO] retained for the manufacture of Linear Alkyl Benzene [LAB]
LAB manufacturers have stated that they receive superior Kerosene oil (SKO) from a refinery. These manufacturers extract n-Paraffin (C9-C13 hydrocarbons) from SKO and return back the remaining of SKO to the refinery. In this context, the issue had arisen as to whether in this transaction GST would be levied on SKO sent by IOC for extracting n-paraffin or only on the n-paraffin quantity extracted by the LAB manufactures. Further, doubt was also raised as to whether the return of remaining Kerosene by LAB manufactures would separately attract GST in such transaction.
LAB manufacturers generally receive SKO from a refinery through a dedicated pipeline. On an average about 15 to $17 \%$ of the total quantity of SKO received from refinery is retained and balance quantity ranging from $83 \%-85 \%$ is returned back to refinery. The retained SKO is towards extraction of Normal Paraffin, which is used in the manufacturing of LAB. In this transaction consideration is paid by LAB manufactures only on the quantity of retained SKO (n-paraffin).
It has been clarified that GST will be payable by the refinery only on the net quantity of SKO retained for the manufacture of LAB. However, the refinery will be liable to pay on the returned quantity also if it is supplied to any other person

# Circular No. 16/16/2017-GST

## Dated: 15.11.2017

Sub: Clarifications regarding applicability of GST and availability of ITC in respect of certain services.
Applicability of GST on warehousing of agricultural produce such as tea, processed coffee beans or powder, pulses, jaggery, processed spices, processed dry fruits, processed cashew nuts etc.
As per the Exemption Notification No. 11/2017-CT(R) dated 28th June 2017-w.e.f 1.7.2017, GST rate on loading, unloading, packing, storage or warehousing of agricultural produce is NIL. Agricultural produce in the notification has been defined to mean "any produce out of cultivation of plants and rearing of all life forms of animals, except the rearing of horses, for food, fibre, fuel, raw material or other similar products, on which either no further processing is done, or such processing is done as is usually done by a cultivator or producer which does not alter its essential characteristics but makes it marketable for primary market".

Tea used for making the beverage, such as black tea, green tea, white tea is a processed product made in tea factories after carrying out several processes, such as drying, rolling, shaping, refining, oxidation, packing etc. on green leaf and is the processed output of the same.
Thus, green tea leaves and not tea is the "agricultural produce" eligible for exemption available for loading, unloading, packing, storage or warehousing of agricultural produce. Same is the case with coffee obtained after processing of coffee beans. Similarly, processing of sugarcane into jaggery changes its essential characteristics. Thus, jaggery is also not an agricultural produce.
Pulses commonly known as dal are obtained after dehusking or splitting or both. The process of de-husking or splitting is usually not carried out by farmers or at farm level but by the pulse millers. Therefore pulses (dehusked or split) are also not agricultural produce. However whole pulse grains such as whole gram, rajma etc. are covered in the definition of agricultural produce.
In view of the above, it has been clarified that processed products such as tea (i.e. black tea, white tea etc.), processed coffee beans or powder, pulses (de-husked or split), jaggery, processed spices, processed dry fruits, processed cashew nuts etc. fall outside the definition of agricultural produce given in Notification No. 11/2017- Central Tax (Rate) and 12/2017Central Tax (Rate) dated 28th June 2017.

The equipment is imported at GST rate of$28 \%$ and leased further in India where operator is supplied by the leasing company, diesel for working of machine is supplied by customer and transportation cost including loading and unloading is also paid by the customer | Leasing or rental services, with or without operator, for any purpose are taxed at the same rate of GST as applicable on supply of like goods involving transfer of title in goods. Thus, the GST rate for the rental services in the given case shall be$28 \%$, provided the said goods attract GST of $28 \%$. IGST paid at the time of import of these goods would be available for discharging IGST on rental services. Thus, only the value added gets taxed. [SI. No 17(vii) of notification No. 11/2017- CT(Rate) dated 28.6.17 as amended refers].  Comment: please note that there should be no further confusion and rental of vehicles or equipment will be liable to 'rate of GST on supply' of them. There is no general rate on rental at $18 \%$. |

| 5. | Is GST leviable in following cases: (1) Hospitals hire senior doctors/ consultants/ technicians independently, without any contract of such persons with the patient; and pay them consultancy charges, without there being any employer employee relationship. Will such consultancy charges be exempt from GST? Will revenue take a stand that they are providing services to hospitals and not to patients and hence must pay GST?(2) Retention money: Hospitals charge the patients, say, Rs.10000/- and pay to the consultants/ technicians only Rs. 7500/- and keep the balance for providing ancillary services which include nursing care, infrastructure facilities, paramedic care, emergency services, checking of temperature, weight, blood pressure etc. Will GST be applicable on such money retained by the hospitals? (3) Food supplied to the patients: Health care services provided by the clinical establishments will include food supplied to the patients; but such food may be prepared by the canteens run by the hospitals or may be outsourced by the Hospitals from outdoor caterers. When outsourced, there should be no ambiguity that the suppliers shall charge tax as applicable and hospital will get no ITC. If hospitals have their own canteens and prepare their own food; then no ITC will be available on inputs including capital goods and in turn if they supply food to the doctors and their staff; such supplies, even when not charged, may be subjected to GST. | Health care services provided by a clinical establishment, an authorised medical practitioner or para-medics are exempt. [SI. No. 74 of notification No. 12/2017CT(Rate) dated 28.06.2017 as amended refers]. (1) Services provided by senior doctors/ consultants/ technicians hired by the hospitals, whether employees or not, are healthcare services which are exempt.  (2) Healthcare services have been defined to mean any service by way of diagnosis or treatment or care for illness, injury, deformity, abnormality or pregnancy in any recognised system of medicines in India [Para 2(zg) of notification No. 12/2017- CT(Rate)]. Therefore, hospitals also provide healthcare services. The entire amount charged by them from the patients including the retention money and the fee/payments made to the doctors etc., is towards the healthcare services provided by the hospitals to the patients and is exempt. (3) Food supplied to the in-patients as advised by the doctor/ nutritionists is a part of composite supply of healthcare and not separately taxable. Other supplies of food by a hospital to patients (not admitted) or their attendants or visitors are taxable. Comment: Care should be taken to charge tax on supplies to anyone 'other than patient' by the Clinical Establishment. And supplies directly 'by' third person to patient or attender are not exempt under this category. |

6. Appropriate clarification may be issued regarding taxability of Cost Petroleum

As per the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) between the Government and the oil exploration \& production contractors, in case of a commercial discovery of petroleum, the contractors are entitled to recover from the sale proceeds all expenses incurred in exploration, development, production and payment of royalty. Portion of the value of petroleum which the contractor is entitled to take in a year for recovery of these contract costs is called "Cost Petroleum". The relationship of the oil exploration and production contractors with the Government is not that of partners but that of licensor/lessor and licensee/lessee in terms of the Petroleum and Natural Gas Rules, 1959. Having acquired the right to explore, exploit and sell petroleum in lieu of royalty and a share in profit petroleum, contractors carry out the exploration and production of petroleum for themselves and not as a service to the Government. Para 8.1 of the Model Production Sharing Contract (MPSC) states that subject to the provisions of the PSC, the Contractor shall have exclusive right to carry out Petroleum Operations to recover costs and expenses as provided in this Contract. The oil exploration and production contractors conduct all petroleum operations at their sole risk, cost and expense. Hence, cost petroleum is not a consideration for service to GOI and thus not taxable per se. However, cost petroleum may be an indication of the value of mining or exploration services provided by operating member to the joint venture, in a situation where the operating member is found to be supplying service to the oil exploration and production joint venture.

Sub: Joint Venture ---taxable services provided by the members of the Joint Venture (JV) to the JV and vice versa and inter se between the members of the JV

The law with regard to levy of GST on service supplied by member of an unincorporated joint venture (JV) to the JV or to other members of the JV, or by JV to the members, essentially remains the same as it was under service tax law.
Example A: There are 4 members in the JV including the operating member and each one contributes Rs 100 as part of their share. A total amount of Rs 400 is collected. The operating member purchases machinery for Rs 400 for the JV to be used in oil production.
Example A will not be the subject matter of 'ST/GST' for the reason that the operating member is not carrying out an activity for another for consideration. In Illustration A, the money paid for purchase of machinery is merely in the nature of capital contribution and is therefore a transaction in money.

## Circular No. 36/10/2018-GST

## Dated: 13.03.2018

Sub: Processing of refund applications for UIN entities
The GST Council, in its 23rd meeting held at Guwahati on 10th November 2017, has decided that the entities having Unique Identity Number (UIN) may be given centralized registration at the option of such entities.

## Status of registration for UINs:

- Entities having UINs are given a special status under the CGST Act as these are not covered under the definition of registered person. These entities have been granted UINs to enable them to claim refund of GST paid on inward supply of goods or services or both received by them. If such entity is making supply of goods or services or both in the course or furtherance of business then such entity will need to apply for GSTIN as per the provisions contained in the CGST Act.

## Filing of return by UIN agencies:

- The procedure for filing returns by UIN entities is specified under sub-rule (1) of Rule 82 of the CGST Rules. The UIN entity is required to file details of inward supplies in FORM GSTR-11.

## Applying for refund by UIN agencies:

- All the entities who have been issued UINs and are notified under Section 55 of the CGST Act will be eligible for refund of inward supply of goods or services in terms of notification No. 16/2017-Central Tax (Rate) dated 28th June 2017 as amended.
- It is hereby clarified that all the entities claiming refund shall submit the duly filled in print out of FORM RFD-10 to the jurisdictional Central Tax Commissionerate.
- There may be cases where multiple UINs existed for the same entity but were later merged into one single UIN. In such cases, field formations are requested to process refund claims for earlier unmerged UINs also. Hence, the refund application will be made with the single UIN only but invoices of old UINs may be declared in the refund claim, which may be accepted and taken into naccount while processing the refund claim.

# Passing of refund order and settlement of funds:

- The facility of centrailzed UIN ensures that irrespective of the type of tax (CGST, SGST, IGST or Cess) and the State where such inward supply of goods or services have been procured, all refunds would be processed by Central authorities only. Therefore, field formations are advised that all refunds are to be processed on merits irrespective of where and which type of tax is paid on inward supply of goods or services or both by such entities.

## Circular No. 37/11/2018-GST

## Dated: 15.03.2018

Sub: Clarifications on exports related refund issues.

## Non-availablement of drawback:

- A supplier availing of drawback only with respect to basic customs duty shall be eligible for refund of unutilized input tax credit of central tax / State tax / Union territory tax / integrated tax / compensation cess under the said provision. It is further clarified that refund of eligible Page 2 of 8 credit on account of State tax shall be available even if the supplier of goods or services or both has availed of drawback in respect of central tax.

## Amendment through Table 9 of GSTR-1:

- It has been reported that refund claims are not being processed on account of mis-matches between data contained in FORM GSTR-1, FORM GSTR-3B and shipping bills/bills of export.

## Exports without LUT:

- Export of goods or services can be made without payment of integrated tax under the provisions of rule 96A of the Central Goods and Services Tax Rules, 2017 (the CGST Rules). Under the said provisions, an exporter is required to furnish a bond or Letter of Undertaking (LUT) to the jurisdictional Commissioner before effecting zero rated supplies. It has been brought to the notice of the Board that in some cases, such zero rated supplies have been made before filing the LUT and refund claims for unutilized input tax credit have been filed.

## Exports after specified period:

- Rule 96A (1) of the CGST Rules provides that any registered person may export goods or services without payment of integrated tax after furnishing a LUT / bond and that he would be liable to pay the tax due along with the interest as applicable within a period of fifteen days after the expiry of three months or such further period as may be allowed by the Commissioner from the date of issue of the invoice for export, if the goods are not exported out of India.
- It has been reported that the exporters have been asked to pay integrated tax where the goods have been exported but not within three months from the date of the issue of the invoice for export. In this regard, it is emphasised that exports have been zero rated under the Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 (IGST Act) and as long as goods have actually been exported even after a period of three months, payment of integrated tax first and claiming refund at a subsequent date should not be insisted upon.

# Deficiency Memo:

- It may be noted that if the application for refund is complete an acknowledgement in FORM GST RFD-02 should be issued.
- In this connection, a clarification has been sought whether with respect to a refund claim, deficiency memo can be issued more than once. In this regard rule 90 of the CGST Rules may be referred to, wherein it has been clearly stated that once an applicant has been communicated the deficiencies in respect of a particular application, the applicant shall furnish a fresh refund application after rectification of such deficiencies. It is therefore, clarified that there can be only one deficiency memo for one refund application and once such a memo has been issued, the applicant is required to file a fresh refund application, manually in FORM GST RFD-01A.

## Self-declaration for non-prosecution:

- It is learnt that some field formations are asking for a self-declaration with every refund claim to the effect that the claimant has not been prosecuted.
- The facility of export under LUT is available to all exporters, except to those who have been prosecuted for any offence under the CGST Act or the IGST Act or any of the existing laws in force in a case where the amount of tax evaded exceeds two hundred and fifty lakh rupees.
- It is clarified that this requirement is already satisfied in case of exports under LUT and asking for self-declaration with every refund claim where the exports have been made under LUT is not warranted.

## Refund of transitional credit:

- Refund of unutilized input tax credit is allowed in two scenarios mentioned in sub-section (3) of section 54 of the CGST Act. These two scenarios are zero rated supplies made without payment of tax and inverted tax structure. In sub-rule (4) and (5) of rule 89 of the CGST Rules, the amount of refund under these scenarios is to be calculated using the formulae given in the said sub-rules. The formulae use the phrase 'Net ITC' and defines the same as "input tax credit availed on inputs and input services during the relevant period other than the input tax credit availed for which refund is claimed under sub rules (4A) or (4B) or both".
  Discrepancy between values of GST invoice and shipping bill/bill of export:
- It has been brought to the notice of the Board that in certain cases, where the refund of unutilized input tax credit on account of export of goods is claimed and the value declared in the

tax invoice is different from the export value declared in the corresponding shipping bill under the Customs Act, refund claims are not being processed. The matter has been examined and it is clarified that the zero rated supply of goods is effected under the provisions of the GST laws.

- During the processing of the refund claim, the value of the goods declared in the GST invoice and the value in the corresponding shipping bill / bill of export should be examined and the lower of the two values should be sanctioned as refund.

## Refund of taxes paid under existing laws:

- CGST Act provide that refunds of tax/duty paid under the existing law shall be disposed of in accordance with the provisions of the existing law. It is observed that certain taxpayers have applied for such refund claims in FORM GST RFD-01A also. In this regard, the field formations are advised to reject such applications and pass a rejection order in FORM GST PMT-03 and communicate the same on the common portal in FORM GST RFD-01B. The procedures laid down under the existing laws viz., Central Excise Act, 1944 and Chapter V of the Finance Act, 1994 read with above referred subsections of section 142 of the CGST Act shall be followed while processing such refund claims.
- Furthermore, it has been brought to the notice of the Board that the field formations are rejecting, withholding or re-crediting CENVAT credit, while processing claims of refund filed under the existing laws. In this regard, attention is invited to sub-section (3) of section 142 of the CGST Act which provides that the amount of refund arising out of such claims shall be refunded in cash.

## Filing frequency of Refunds:

- The exporter, at his option, may file refund claim for one calendar month / quarter or by clubbing successive calendar months / quarters. The calendar month(s) / quarter(s) for which refund claim has been filed, however, cannot spread across different financial years.

## BRC / FIRC for export of goods:

- It is clarified that the realization of convertible foreign exchange is one of the conditions for export of services. In case of export of goods, realization of consideration is not a pre-condition.
- Insistence on proof of realization of export proceeds for processing of refund claims related to export of goods has not been envisaged in the law and should not be insisted upon.

## Supplies to Merchant Exporters:

- The benefit of supplies at concessional rate is subject to certain conditions and the said benefit is optional. The option may or may not be availed by the supplier and / or the recipient and the goods may be procured at the normal applicable tax rate.
- It is also clarified that the exporter will be eligible to take creditof the tax @ $0.05 \%$ / $0.1 \%$ paid by him. The supplier who supplies goods at the concessional rate is also eligible for refund on account of inverted tax structure as per the provisions of clause (ii) of the first proviso to sub-section (3) of section 54 of the CGST Act. It may also be noted that the exporter of such goods can export the goods only under LUT / bond and cannot export on payment of integrated tax.

## Requirement of invoices for processing of claims for refund:

- It was envisaged that only the specified statements would be required for processing of refund claims because the details of outward supplies and inward supplies would be available on the common portal which would be matched. Most of the other information like shipping bills details etc.
- A list of documents required for processing the various categories of refund claims on exports is provided in the Table below. Apart from the documents listed in the Table below, no other documents should be called for from the taxpayers, unless the same are not available with the officers electronically:

Sub: Issues on Job Work provisions under GST from perspective of

A. Scope of Job Work: Job work is a treatment or process undertaken by a person on goods belonging to another registered person. Thus, the job worker is expected to work on the goods sent by the principal and whether the activity is covered within the scope of job work or not would have to be determined on the basis of facts and circumstances of each case. Further, it is clarified that the job worker, in addition to the goods received from the principal, can use his own goods for providing the services of job work.
Author's observation: Job work can be either a pure service such as packing, labelling, etc where inputs supplied by Principal are put together as per specification or it can be a work contract service such as stitching, washing, etc where primary input/semi-finished goods are supplied by Principal and job-worker also applies own goods to complete the service.
B. Requirement of registration for the principal/ job worker: It is important to note that the provisions of GST Act relating to jobwork are applicable to a registered person. Further, it is his choice whether or not to avail benefit of these special provisions.
It is also clarified that a job worker is required to obtain registration only in cases where his aggregate turnover, to be computed on all India basis, in a financial year exceeds the threshold limit regardless of whether the principal and the job worker are located in the same State or in different States.
Author's observation: Principal is not required to obtain registration if its turnover does not exceed threshold limit. In such case, special provisions of GST Act relating to job-work will not apply.
Entity providing job-work services shall calculate turnover of all the goods and services supplied by them rather than turnover of only job-work services to determine whether it is required to obtain registration.
C. Supply of goods by the principal from job worker's place of business / premises: The supply of goods by the principal from the place of business / premises of the job worker will be regarded as supply by the principal and not by the job worker.
Author's observation: Even though finished goods are supplied to principal's customer from job-workers premises, the value of such supply will not be included in turnover of job-worker. Moreover, for the generation of E-way bill, Principal shall remain responsible.
D. Movement of goods from the principal to the job worker and the documents and infimation required therefore: Rule 45 of the CGST Rules provides that inputs, semi-finished goods or capital goods shall be sent to the job worker under the cover of a delivery challan issued by the principal, including in cases where such goods are sent directly to a job worker.
The principal is also required to file FORM GST ITC-04 every quarter stating details of inputs, semi-finished goods and capital goods transferred to job-worker, sent from one job worker to another job worker, directly sold from premises of job-worker and received back from jobworker.
Further, as per the provisions of rule 138 of the CGST Rules, an e-way bill is required to be generated by every registered person who causes movement of goods of consignment value exceeding fifty thousand rupees even in cases where such movement is for reasons other than for supply (e.g. in case of movement for job work).
Further, it is provided that the e-way bill shall be generated either by the principal or by the registered job worker irrespective of the value of the consignment, where goods are sent by a principal located in one State/Union territory to a job worker located in any other State/ Union territory.
Author's observation: Delivery challan and E-way bill are the documents to be accompanied with every transfer of goods between Principal and Job-worker. Following the special procedures for job-work entails furnishing of additional quarterly return in FORM GST ITC-04.
(i) Where goods are sent by principal to only one job worker: The principal shall prepare in triplicate, the challan in terms of rules 45 and 55 of the CGST Rules, for sending the goods to a job worker. Two copies of the challan may be sent to the job worker along with the goods.
(ii) Where the goods are returned to the principal by the job worker: The job worker should send one copy of the challan received by him from the principal while returning the goods to the principal after carrying out the job work.
Author's observation: In fact 4 copies of delivery challan should be prepared, 1 for self, 1 for transporter and 2 for job-worker. Out of the 2 copies, 1 copy shall be returned by job-worker at time of returning goods to principal. A copy of delivery challan so received from job worker should be preserved along with originally prepared delivery challan.
(iii) Where goods are sent from one job worker to another job worker: The goods may move under the cover of a challan issued either by the principal or the job worker. In the alternative, the challan issued by the principal may be endorsed by the job worker sending the goods to another job worker, indicating therein the quantity and description of goods being sent.
Author's observation: Transfer from one job worker to another through endorsement of principal's delivery challan would relieve job work service providers fromadditional documentation.
(iv) Where the goods are sent directly by the supplier to the job worker: In this case, the goods may move from the place of business of the supplier to the premises of the job worker with a copy of the invoice issued by the supplier in the name of the buyer (i.e. the principal) wherein the job worker's name and address should also be mentioned as the consignee. In case of import of goods by the principal which are then supplied directly from the customs station of import, the goods may move from the customs station of import to the place of business/premises of the job worker with a copy of the Bill of Entry. The buyer (i.e., the principal) shall issue the delivery challan under rule 45 of the CGST Rules and send the same to the job worker directly in terms of para (i) above.
Author's observation: In case of direct delivery of goods by supplier to job-worker, while supplier's invoice and/or bill of entry shall contain name and GSTIN of Principal, the principal is required to issue delivery challan to job-worker.
(v) Where goods are returned in piecemeal by the job worker: In case the goods after carrying out the job work, are sent in piecemeal quantities by a job worker to another job worker or to the principal, the challan issued originally by the principal cannot be endorsed and a fresh challan is required to be issued by the job worker.
Author's observation: Transfer of goods in small quantities would require job-worker to issue fresh challans along with goods. However, it is advisable to mention unique reference no. of principal's delivery challan in each fresh challan issued.
(vi) Submission of intimation: The FORM GST ITC-04 will serve as the intimation as envisaged under section 143 of the CGST Act.
E. Liability to issue invoice, determination of place of supply and payment of GST: In response to doubts raised about the time, value and place of supply in the hands of principal or job worker as also about the issuance of invoices by the principal or job worker, following is clarified:

## (i) Supply of job work services:

The job worker, as a supplier of services, is liable to pay GST if he is liable to be registered. He shall issue an invoice at the time of supply of the services as determined in terms of section 13 read with section 31 of the CGST Act.
The value of services would include not only the service charges but also the value of any goods or services used by him for supplying the job work services, if recovered from the principal. Further, it is clarified that the value of such moulds and dies, jigs and fixtures or tools may not be included in the value of job work services provided its value has been factored in the price for the supply of such services by the job worker.

If the job worker is not registered, GST would be payable by the principal on reverse charge basis in terms of the provisions contained in section 9(4) of the CGST Act. However, the said provision has been kept in abeyance for the time being.

# Author's observation:

(1) The cost of moulds, dies, jigs and fixtures, etc will have to be expressly apportioned by job worker while determining price to be charged to principal.
(2) Services of unregistered job worker will attract GST under reverse charge, however such tax under reverse charge has been exempted till 30th June, 2018.
(ii) Supply of goods by the principal from the place of business/ premises of job worker:
Since the supply is being made by the principal, it is clarified that the time, value and place of supply would have to be determined in the hands of the principal irrespective of the location of the job worker's place of business/premises.
Further, the invoice would have to be issued by the principal. It is also clarified that in case of exports directly from the job worker's place of business/premises, the LUT or bond, as the case may be, shall be executed by the principal.
Illustration: The principal is located in State A, the job worker in State B and the recipient in State C. In case the supply is made from the job worker's place of business / premises, the invoice will be issued by the supplier (principal) located in State A to the recipient located in State C. The said transaction will be an inter-State supply. In case the recipient is also located in State A, it will be an intra-State supply.
Author's observation: Firstly, if principal wishes to supply goods directly from job worker's premises, either job worker should be registered under GST or principal will have to add job-worker's premises as its "additional place of business" in case job worker is unregistered under GST. Secondly, whether or not job worker is registered, time, value and place of supply of goods will be determined as if goods are supplied by principal.

## (iii) Supply of waste and scrap generated during the job work:

Waste and scrap generated during the job work may be supplied by the registered job worker directly from his place of business or by the principal in case the job worker is not registered. The principles enunciated in para (ii) above would apply mutatis mutandis in this case.

Author's observation: If waste and scrap are sold by unregistered job worker, it would be treated as if same has been sold by principal and accordingly, principal shall be liable to GST.
F. Violation of conditions laid down in section 143: If the inputs or capital goods are neither returned nor supplied from the job worker's place of business / premises within the specified time period, the principal would issue an invoice for the same and declare such supplies in his return for that particular month in which the time period of one year / three years

has expired. The date of supply shall be the date on which such inputs or capital goods were initially sent to the job worker and interest for the intervening period shall also be payable on the tax.
If such goods are returned by the job worker after the stipulated time period, the same would be treated as a supply by the job worker to the principal and the job worker would be liable to pay GST if he is liable for registration
Author's observation: It is important to note that if goods or capital goods are not returned/sold within one year / three year, principal need to issue tax invoice in month in which one year / three years expire and include such invoice in GST returns of that month. However, interest on GST has to be paid from date of actual supply to job worker.
G. Availability of input tax credit to the principal and job worker: The input tax credit would be available to the principal, irrespective of the fact whether the inputs or capital goods are received by the principal and then sent to the job worker for processing, etc. or whether they are directly received at the job worker's place of business/premises, without being brought to the premises of the principal. It is also clarified that the job worker is also eligible to avail ITC on inputs, etc. used by him in supplying the job work services if he is registered.
Author's observation: Special provisions under GST for job-work transactions do not restrict input tax credit either on part of principal or job-worker has been provided under. However, input tax credit shall be subject to general conditions and restriction provided under GST Act.
Conclusion: This circular essentially clarifies procedures to be followed for job work transactions and efficient implementation of these procedures and adequate documentation will go long way in avoiding unnecessary litigation.

Sub: Queries regarding processing of refund applications for UIN agencies The Board vide Circular No. 36/10/2017 dated 13th March, 2018 clarified and specified the detailed procedure for UIN refunds. After issuance of the Circular, a number of queries and representations have been received regarding the processing of refund to agencies which have been allotted UINs.

1. Providing statement of invoices while submitting the refund application:

The procedure for filing a refund application has been outlined under rule 95 of the Central Goods and Services Tax Rules, 2017 (hereinafter referred to as the CGST Rules) which provides for filing of refund on a quarterly basis in FORM RFD-10 along with a statement of inward invoices in FORM GSTR-11.

It has come to the notice of the
Board that the print version of FORM GSTR-11 generated by the system does not have
Invoice - wise details, Therefore, it is clarified that till the system generated FORM GSTR-11 does not have invoice-level details, UIN agencies are requested to manually furnish a statement containing the details of all the invoices on which refund has been claimed, along with refund application.
Further, the officers are advised not to request for original or hard copy of the invoices unless necessary.

1. No mention of UINs on Invoices:

It has been represented that many suppliers did not record the UINs on the invoices of supplies of goods or services to UIN agencies. It is hereby clarified that the recording of UIN on the invoice is a necessary condition under rule 46 of the CGST Rules, 2017. If suppliers / vendors are not recording the UINs, action may be initiated against them under the provisions of the CGST Act, 2017.

Further, in cases where, UIN has not been recorded on the invoices pertaining to refund claim for the quarters of July - September 2017, October - December 2017 and January - March 2018, a one-time waiver is being given by the Government, subject to the condition that copies of such invoices will be submitted to the jurisdictional officers and will be attested by the authorized representative of the UIN agency.

# Circular No. 44/18/2018-GST

## Dated: 02.05.2018

Sub: Issue related to taxability of 'tenancy rights' under GST.
Doubts have been raised as to,-
(i) Whether transfer of tenancy rights to an incoming tenant, consideration for which is in form of tenancy premium, shall attract GST when stamp duty and registration charges is levied on the said premium, if yes what would be the applicable rate?
The activity of transfer of tenancy right against consideration in the form of tenancy premium is a supply of service liable to GST. It is a form of lease or renting of property and such activity is specifically declared to be a service in para 2 of Schedule II i.e. any lease, tenancy, easement, licence to occupy land is a supply of services.
The contention that stamp duty and registration charges is levied on such transfers of tenancy rights, and such transaction thus should not

be subjected to GST, is not relevant. Merely because a transaction or a supply involves execution of documents which may require registration and payment of registration fee and stamp duty, would not preclude them from the scope of supply of goods and services and from payment of GST. The transfer of tenancy rights cannot be treated as sale of land or building declared as neither a supply of goods nor of services.
Thus a consideration for the said activity shall attract levy of GST.
(ii) Further, in case of transfer of tenancy rights, a part of the consideration for such transfer accrues to the outgoing tenant, whether such supplies will also attract GST?
To sum up, the activity of transfer of 'tenancy rights' is squarely covered under the scope of supply and taxable per-se. Transfer of tenancy rights to a new tenant against consideration in the form of tenancy premium is taxable. However, renting of residential dwelling for use as a residence is exempt [SI. No. 12 of notification No. 12/2017-Central Tax (Rate)]. Hence, grant of tenancy rights in a residential dwelling for use as residence dwelling against tenancy premium or periodic rent or both is exempt. As regards services provided by outgoing tenant by way of surrendering the tenancy rights against consideration in the form of a portion of tenancy premium is liable to GST.

# Circular No. 45/19/2018-GST

## Dated: 30.05.2018

Sub: Clarifications on refund related issues
A Summary of the Circular is presented below:

1. Claim for refund filed by an ISD, a person paying tax under composition scheme or a non-resident taxable person - GSTR 1 \& GSTR 3B not mandatory
   Para 2.0 of Circular No. 24/24/2017-GST dated 21.12.2017 mandates that the refund claim for a tax period may be filed only after filing the details in FORM GSTR-1 for the said tax period and that it is also to be ensured that a valid return in FORM GSTR3B has been filed for the last tax period before the one in which the refund application is being filed.
   However, vide this Circular it is clarified that in case of a claim for refund of balance in the electronic cash ledger filed by an ISD or a composition taxpayer; and the claim for refund of balance in the electronic cash and/or credit ledger by a non-resident taxable person, the filing of the details in FORM GSTR-1 and the return in FORM GSTR-3B is not mandatory.
   Instead, the return in FORM GSTR-4 filed by a composition taxpayer, the details in FORM GSTR-6 filed by an ISD and the return in FORM GSTR-5 filed by a non-resident taxable person shall be sufficient for claiming the said refund.
2. Application for refund of integrated tax paid on export of services and supplies made to a SEZ developer or a SEZ unit

Registered persons are unable to file the refund application in FORM GST RFD-01A for refund of integrated tax paid on the export of services or on supplies made to a SEZ developer or a SEZ unit on the GST common portal because of an in-built validation check in the system which restricts the refund amount claimed (integrated tax/cess) to the amount of integrated tax/ cess mentioned under column 3.1(b) of FORM GSTR-3B (zero rated supplies) filed for the corresponding tax period.
In this regard, it is clarified that for the tax periods commencing from 01.07.2017 to 31.03.2018, such registered persons shall be allowed to file the refund application in FORM GST RFD-01A on the common portal subject to the condition that the amount of refund of integrated tax/cess claimed shall not be more than the aggregate amount of integrated tax/cess mentioned in the Table under columns 3.1(a), 3.1(b) and 3.1(c) of FORM GSTR-3B filed for the corresponding tax period.

## Circular No. 46/20/2018-GST

## Dated: 06.06.2018

Sub: Applicable GST rate on Priority Sector Lending Certificates (PSLCs), Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) and other similar scrips.
Representations have been received seeking clarification regarding the classification and applicable GST rate on the Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) and Priority Sector Lending Certificates (PSLCs).
Earlier, in response to a FAQ, it was clarified (vide advertisement dated 27.07.2017), that MEIS and other scrips like SEIS and IEIS are goods classified under heading 4907 and attract $12 \%$ GST, which is the general GST rate for goods falling under heading 4907. Subsequently, the duty credit scrips classifiable under 4907 were exempted from GST, while stock, share or bond certificates and similar documents of title [other than Duty Credit Scrips], classifiable under heading 4907, attract $12 \%$ GST.
Later on, Circular No. 34/8/2018- GST dated 01.03.2018 (S.No.3) was issued clarifying that PSLCs are taxable as goods at a standard rate of $18 \%$ under the residual entry S. No. 453 of Schedule III of notification No. 01/2017-Central Tax (Rate).
As a result, there is lack of clarity on the applicable rate of GST on various scrips/ certificates like RECs, PSLCs etc.
The matter has been re-examined. GST rate of $18 \%$ under the residual entry at S.No. 453 of Schedule III of notification No. 01/2017-Central Tax (Rate) applies only to those goods which are not covered under any other entries of Schedule I, II, IV, V, or VI of the notification. In other words, if any goods are covered under any of the entries of Schedule I, II, IV, V, or VI, the GST rate applicable on them will be decided accordingly, without resorting to the residual entry 453 of Schedule III.
As such, various certificates like RECs, PSLCs etc are classified under heading 4907 and will accordingly attract GST @ $12 \%$, though duty paying scrips classifiable under the same heading will attract Nil GST(under S.No. 122A of Notification No. 2/2017-Central Tax (Rate) dated 28.06.2017, as amended

vide Notification No. 35/2017-Central Tax (Rate) dated 13.10.2017).
7. Accordingly, in modification of S.No. 3 of Circular No. 34/8/2018- GST dated 01.03.2018, it is hereby clarified that Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) and Priority Sector Lending Certificates (PSLCs) and other similar documents are classifiable under heading 4907 and attract $12 \%$ GST. The duty credit scrips, however, attract Nil GST under S.No. 122A of Notification No. 2/2017-Central Tax (Rate) dated 28.06.2017.

# Circular No. 47/21/2018-GST

## Dated: 08.06.2018

Sub: Clarifications of certain issues under GST.

1. Moulds and dies owned by Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) that are sent free of cost (FOC) to a component manufacturer (regarding liability of tax \& reversal of credit)
   Since in the service tax regime, the cost of free supply of material supplied by service recipient to service provider was to be added in the taxable value. This concept has generated a lot of litigation and ultimately, it has been decided by Apex Court in case of Bhayana Builders. But there is no such concept in the GST regime. Thus, the cost of free supply material is not to be added to arrive at taxable value. This is also clarified by CBIC in this circular.

However, circular further says that if the agreement between provider and recipient says that the material was to be supplied by provider only. But the recipient has supplied this material to provider then its value is to be added in the taxable value. Hence, the litigation of service tax regime does not end here and continued in the GST also.
Moreover, the problem arises when the moulds and dies are supplied free of charge by recipient. But the agreement says that the same is to be purchased by provider on his own. But crux of problem is that the complete value of dies and moulds cannot be loaded in a single transaction. A example will clarify the same.
Suppose, a die of Rs. 10,000/-can be used to manufacture 10,00,000 pieces. But the recipient has ordered only 5000 pieces @ 10/- per piece. Now the complete cost of die comes to Rs. 10,000/- cannot be loaded to supply of 5000 pieces. Hence, the amortised value is to be arrived at and value is to be added. So, we will calculate the amortized value by dividing 10,000 by $10,00,000$ and will add per unit cost in the GST value. This was concept prevailing in service tax regime and now it has been added in GST regime also. Litigation will take place on this issue also.

1. Liability of tax in case of Servicing of cars involving both supply of goods (spare parts) and services (labour) -
   This dispute was going on since long as to whether the service provided by authorized service stations will be termed as composite supply and it will be taxed accordingly. But most of the service providers, bill separately for material as well as for labour charges. Many representations have been sent to the Government in this regard. Hence, they were billing at the rates applicable on them.

Now it has been clarified that if assessee supply both goods and services and the value of such goods and services supplied are shown separately, then goods and services would be liable to tax at the rates as applicable to such goods and services separately.
2. Auction of tea, coffee, rubber etc. (regarding maintenance of books of accounts \& eligibility to avail input tax credit)
Books of accounts will be maintained at the principal place of business and additional place(s) of business as follow-
O The principal and the auctioneer may declare the warehouses, where such goods are stored, as their additional place of business.
O The buyer is also required to disclose such warehouse as his additional place of business if he wants to store the goods purchased through auction in such warehouses.
(For the purpose of supply of tea through a private treaty, the principal and an auctioneer may also comply with the said provisions) The principal and the auctioneer are required to maintain the books of accounts relating to each and every place of business in that place it. However, in case of any difficulty, they may maintain the books of accounts relating to the additional place(s) of business at their principal place of business. (Principal and the auctioneer are required to intimate their jurisdictional officer in writing about the same.)

Principal and the auctioneer shall be eligible to avail input tax credit subject to the fulfillment of other provisions of the CGST Act read with the rules made there under.

1. E-way Bill-Whether goods can be delivered without producing e-way bill at the time of delivery in case of transportation of goods by railways.
   It has been clarified that Railways shall not deliver the goods unless the e-way bill is produced at the time of delivery.
2. Whether e-way bill is requiredin the following cases-
3. Where goods are sent in another State while moving from one area in a State to another area in the same State -
   The circular states that, if the goods are sent in second State while moving from one place in a State to another place in the same State, an e-way bill is required to be generated.
4. Where goods move from a DTA unit to a SEZ unit or vice versa located in the same State-
   Where goods move from a DTA unit to a SEZ unit or vice versa located in the same State, there is no requirement to generate an e-way bill (this exemption is applicable only if state has exempted the same.) Means for Rajasthan E-way is required to be generated as there is no exemption regarding the same.

Sub: Modifications to the procedure for interception of conveyances for inspection of goods in movement, and detention, release and confiscation of such goods and conveyances, as clarified in Circular No. 41/15/2018-GST dated 13.04.2018
In order to clarify certain issues regarding the specified procedure in this regard and in order to ensure uniform implementation of the provisions of the CGST Act across all the field formations, the Board, in exercise of the powers conferred under section 168 (1) of the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, hereby issues the following modifications to the said Circular:-
i) In para 2 (e) of the said Circular, the expression "three working days" may be replaced by the expression "three days";
ii) The statement after paragraph 3 in FORM GST MOV-05 should read as: "In view of the above, the goods and conveyance(s) are hereby released on (DD/MM/YYYY) at $\qquad$ AM/PM."
Further, it is stated that as per rule 138C (2) of the Central Goods and Services Tax Rules, 2017, where the physical verification of goods being transported on any conveyance has been done during transit at one place within a State or Union territory or in any other State or Union territory, no further physical verification of the said conveyance shall be carried out again in the State or Union territory, unless a specific information relating to evasion of tax is made available subsequently. Since the requisite FORMS are not available on the common portal currently, any action initiated by the State tax officers is not being intimated to the central tax officers and vice-versa, doubts have been raised as to the procedure to be followed in such situations.
In this regard, it is clarified that the hard copies of the notices/orders issued in the specified FORMS by a tax authority may be shown as proof of initiation of action by a tax authority by the transporter/registered person to another tax authority as and when required.
Further, it is clarified that only such goods and/or conveyances should be detained/confiscated in respect of which there is a violation of the provisions of the GST Acts or the rules made thereunder.
Illustration: Where a conveyance carrying twenty-five consignments is intercepted and the person-in-charge of such conveyance produces valid e-way bills and/or other relevant documents in respect of twenty consignments, but is unable to produce the same with respect to the remaining five consignments, detention/confiscation can be made only with respect to the five consignments and the conveyance in respect of which the violation of the Act or the rules made thereunder has been established by the proper officer.

As regards the Service provided by PSPs to the State Governments by way of transportation of patients on behalf of the State Governments against consideration in the form of Fee or otherwise charged from the State Government, it is clarified that the same would be exempt under -
A) SL. No. 3 of Notification No. 12/2017-Central Tax (Rate) dt. 28.06.2017 if it is a pure service and not a composite supply involving supply of any goods, and

Subject: Circular No. 52/26/2018-GST dated 09.08.2018 i.r.o. clarification regarding applicability of GST rates on various goods and services

## Description:

1) Toned milk fortified (with vitamins "A" and "D") attracts NIL rate of GST under HSN Code 0401
2) Beet and cane sugar, including refined beet and cane sugar, fall under heading 1701 and attract $5 \%$ GST rate.
3) As both plain (unmodified) tamarind kernel powder and treated (modified) tamarind kernel powder fall under chapter 13, it is hereby clarified that both attract $5 \%$ GST in terms of the said notification.
4) Accordingly, supply of water, other than those excluded from S. No. 99 of notification No. 2/2017-Central Tax (Rate) dated 28.06.2017, would attract GST at "NIL" rate. Therefore, it is clarified that supply of drinking water for public purposes, if it is not supplied in a sealed container, is exempt from GST.
5) Normal human plasma is specifically mentioned at S. No. 186 of List I under S. No. 180 of Schedule I of the notification No. 1/2017-Central Tax (Rate) dated 28th June, 2017, and attracts 5\% GST. Other items falling under HS Code 3002 (including plasma products) would attract $12 \%$ GST under S. No. 61 of Schedule II of the said notification, not specifically covered in the said List I.
   Thus, a harmonious reading of the two entries would mean that normal human plasma would attract $5 \%$ GST rate under List I (S. No. 186), whereas plasma products would attract $12 \%$ GST rate, if otherwise not specifically covered under the said List.
6) Wipes of various kinds are classifiable under heading 3307 or 3401 depending upon their constituents.
   Therefore, if the baby wipes are impregnated with perfumes or cosmetics, then the same would fall under HS code 3307 and would attract $18 \%$ GST rate. Similarly, if they are coated with soap or detergent, then it would fall under HS code 3401 and would attract $18 \%$ GST.
7) It is clarified that imitation zari thread or yarn known as "Kasab" or by any other name in trade parlance, would attract a uniform GST rate of $12 \%$ under tariff heading 5605.
8) It is clarified that the supplies of marine engine for fishing vessel (being a part of the fishing vessel),falling under tariff item 840810 93 attracts $5 \%$ GST.
9) Cotton quilts falling under tariff heading 9404 attract a GST rate of $5 \%$ if the sale value of such cotton quilts does not exceed Rs. 1000 per piece. However, such cotton quilts, with sale value exceeding Rs. 1000 per piece attract a GST rate of $12 \%$.
   The essential character of the cotton quilt is imparted by the filling material. Therefore, a quilt filled with cotton constitutes a cotton quilt, irrespective of the material of the cover of the quilt. The GST rate would accordingly apply.
10) Fabrication of buses may involve the following two situations:
    (a) Bus body builder builds a bus, working on the chassis owned by him and supplies the built-up bus to the customer, and charges the customer for the value of the bus.
    (b) Bus body builder builds body on chassis provided by the principal for body building, and charges fabrication charges

(including certain material that was consumed during the process of job-work).
(c) It is clarified that in case as mentioned at Para (a) above, the supply made is that of bus, and accordingly supply would attract GST @28\%. In the case as mentioned at Para
(b) above, fabrication of body on chassis provided by the principal (not on account of body builder), the supply would merit classification as service, and $18 \%$ GST as applicable will be charged accordingly.
11) It is clear, in view of the HSN Explanatory Notes that the said goods, namely "Disc Brake pad" for automobiles, are appropriately classifiable under heading 8708 of the Customs Tariff Act, 1975 and would attract $28 \%$ GST.

## Description:

1) GST on petroleum gases, which are supplied by oil refineries to them on a continuous basis through dedicated pipelines, while a portion of the raw material is retained by these manufacturers (recipient of supply), and the remaining quantity is returned to the oil refineries.
2) In this regard, an issue has arisen as to whether in this transaction GST would be leviable on the whole quantity of the principal raw materials supplied by the oil refinery or on the net quantity retained by the manufacturers of petrochemical and chemical products.
3) It is clarified that, GST will be payable by the refinery only on the net quantity of petroleum gases retained by the recipient manufacturer for the manufacture of petrochemical and chemical products. Though, the refinery would be liable to pay GST on such returned quantity of petroleum gases, when the same is supplied by it to any other person. It is reiterated that this clarification would be applicable mutatis mutandis on other cases involving supply of goods, where feed stock is retained by the recipient and remaining residual material is returned back to the supplier. The net billing is done on the amount retained by the recipient.
4) This clarification is issued in the context of the GST only and past issues, if any, will be dealt in accordance with the law prevailing at the material time.

# Circular No. 73/2018

Date: $5^{\text {th }}$ November 2018
Subject: Whether Delcreder Agent (DCA) is Termed as Agent Under GST.

## Description:

- In commercial trade parlance, a DCA is a selling agent who is engaged by a principal to assist in supply of goods or services by contacting potential buyers on behalf of the principal.
- DCA guarantees the payment to the supplier.
- Where the buyer fails to make payment to the principal by the due date, DCA makes the payment to the principal on behalf of the buyer (effectively providing an insurance against default by the buyer
- As a result, commission paid to the DCA may be relatively higher than that paid to a normal agent.
- In order to guarantee timely payment to the supplier, the DCA can resort to various methods including extending short-term transaction-based loans to the buyer or paying the supplier

himself and recovering the amount from the buyer with some interest at a later date.

- This loan is to be repaid by the buyer along with an interest to the DCA at a rate mutually agreed between DCA and buyer.
- Concerns have been expressed regarding the valuation of supplies from Principal to recipient where the payment for such supply is being discharged by the recipient through the loan provided by DCA or by the DCA himself.

Whether a DCA falls under the ambit of agent under Para 3 of Schedule I of the CGST Act?
Whether or not the DCA will fall under the ambit of agent under Para 3 of Schedule I of the CGST Act depends on the following possible scenarios: Yes/No based on circumstances.
a) In case where the invoice for supply of goods is issued by the supplier to the customer, either himself or through DCA, the DCA does not fall under the ambit of agent.
(b) In case where the invoice for supply of goods is issued by the DCA in his own name, the DCA would fall under the ambit of agent.

Whether the temporary shortterm transaction based loan extended by the DCA to the recipient (buyer), for which interest is charged by the DCA, is to be included in the value of goods being supplied by the supplier (principal) where DCA is not an agent under Para 3 of Schedule I of the CGST Act? NO

In such a scenario following activities are taking place:

1. Supply of goods from supplier (principal) to recipient;
2. Supply of agency services from DCA to the supplier or the recipient or both;
3. Supply of extension of loan services by the DCA to the recipient.

It is clarified that in cases where the DCA is not an agent under Para 3 of Schedule I, the temporary shortterm transaction based loan being provided by DCA to the buyer is a supply of service by the DCA to the recipient on Principal to Principal basis and is an independent supply. Therefore, the interest being charged by the DCA would not form part of the value of supply of goods supplied (to the buyer) by the supplier. Furthermore, vide notification No. 12/2017Central Tax (Rate) dated 28th June, 2017 (S. No. 27), services by way of extending deposits, loans or advances in so far as the consideration is represented by way of interest or discount (other than interest involved in credit card services) has been exempted.

Where DCA is an agent under Para 3 of Schedule I of the CGST Act and makes payment to the principal on behalf of the buyer and charges

interest to the buyer for delayed payment along with the value of goods being supplied, whether the interest will form a part of the value of supply of goods also or not? YES

In such a scenario following activities are taking place:

1. Supply of goods by the supplier (principal) to the DCA;
2. Further supply of goods by the DCA to the recipient;
3. Supply of agency services by the DCA to the supplier or the recipient or both;
4. Extension of credit by the DCA to the recipient.

It is clarified that in cases where the DCA is an agent under Para 3 of Schedule I of the CGST Act, the temporary shortterm transaction based credit being provided by DCA to the buyer no longer retains its character of an independent supply and is subsumed in the supply of the goods by the DCA to the recipient. It is emphasized that the activity of extension of credit by the DCA to the recipient would not be considered as a separate supply as it is in the context of the supply of goods made by the DCA to the recipient. Therefore, the value of the interest charged for such credit would be required to be included in the value of supply of goods by DCA to the recipient as per section 15(2)(d) of the CGST Act.

## Circular No. 82/2019

## Date - $1^{\text {st }}$ January 2019

Applicability of GST on various programmes conducted by the Indian Institutes of Managements (IIMs).
All the IIMs listed in the schedule to the IIM Act are "institutions of national importance" \& they are empowered to
(i) grant degrees, diplomas, and other academic distinctions or titles,
(ii) specify the criteria and process for admission to courses or programmes of study, and
(iii) specify the academic content of programmes.

Therefore, with effect from 31st January, 2018, all the IIMs are "educational institutions" as defined under notification No. 12/ 2017- Central Tax (Rate) dated 28.06.2017 as they provide education as a part of a curriculum for obtaining a qualification recognised by law for the time being in force.

At present, Indian Institutes of Managements are providing various long duration programs (one year or more) for which they award diploma/

degree certificate duly recommended by Board of Governors as per the power vested in them under the IIM Act, 2017. Therefore, it is clarified that services provided by Indian Institutes of Managements to their students- in all such long duration programs (one year or more) are exempt from levy of GST.

For the period from 1st July, 2017 to 30th January, 2018, IIMs were not covered by the definition of educational institutions as given in notification No. 12/ 2017 Central Tax (Rate) dated 28.06.2017. Thus, they were not entitled to exemption under SI. No. 66 of the said notification.

However, there was specific exemption to following three programs of IIMs under SI. No. 67 of notification No. 12/2017- Central Tax (Rate):-
(i) 2 year full time Post Graduate Programmes in Management for the Post Graduate Diploma in Management, to which admissions are made on the basis of Common Admission Test (CAT) conducted by the Indian Institute of Management,
(ii) fellow programme in Management,
(iii) 5 years integrated programme in Management.

Therefore, for the period from 1st July, 2017 to 30th January, 2018, GST exemption would be available only to three long duration programs specified above.

It is further, clarified that with effect from 31st January, 2018, all IIMs have become eligible for exemption benefit under SI. No. 66 of notification No. 12/ 2017- Central Tax (Rate) dated 28.06.2017.

As such, specific exemption granted to IIMs vide SI. No. 67 has become redundant. The same has been deleted vide notification No. 28/2018Central Tax (Rate) dated, 31st December, 2018 w.e.f. 1st January 2019.

For the period from 31st January, 2018 to 31st December, 2018, two exemptions, i.e. under SI. No. 66 and under SI. No. 67 of notification No. 12/ 2017- Central Tax (Rate), dated 28.06.2017 are available to the IIMs.

The legal position in such situation has been clarified by Hon'ble Supreme Court in many cases that if there are two or more exemption notifications available to an assessee, the assessee can claim the one that is more beneficial to him. Therefore, from 31st January, 2018 to 31st December, 2018, IIMs can avail exemption either under SI. No 66 or SI. No. 67 of the said notification for the eligible programmes.

Indian Institutes of Managements also provide various short duration/ short term programs for which they award participation certificate to the executives/ professionals as they are considered as "participants" of the said programmes. These participation certificates are not any qualification recognized by law. Such participants are also not considered as students of Indian Institutes of Management. Services provided by IIMs as an educational institution to such participants is not exempt from GST. Such short duration executive programs attract standard rate of GST @ $18 \%$

(CGST 9\% + SGST 9\%).

## Date - $1^{\text {st }}$ January 2019

Clarification on issue of classification of service of printing of pictures covered under 998386.

The service of "printing of pictures" correctly covered under service code 998386 - "Photographic and video-graphic processing services" is being classified by trade under service code 998912 - "Printing and reproduction services of recorded media, on a fee or contract basis".

Service Code 998386 attracts 18\% GST
Service Code 998912 attracts $12 \%$ GST
Therefore wrong classification may lead to short payment of GST.
According to Explanatory Notes to the scheme of classification of services, the service code "998386 Photographic and video-graphic processing services, includes, -

- developing of negatives and the printing of pictures for others

according to customer specifications such as enlargement of negatives or slides, black and white processing

- colour printing of images from film or digital media; slide and negative duplicates, reprints, etc.
- developing of film for both amateur photographers and commercial clients
- preparing of photographic slides; copying of films
- $\quad$ converting of photographs and films to other media

Clarification on GST rate applicable on supply of food and beverage services by educational institution.

Representations have been received seeking clarification as to the rate of GST applicable on supply of food and beverages services by educational institution to its students.

It has been stated that the words "school, college" appearing in Explanation 1 to Entry 7 (i) of Notification No. 11/2017-Central Tax (Rate) dated 28.06.2017 give rise to doubt whether supply of food and drinks by an educational institution to its students is eligible for exemption under Notification No. 12/2017- Central Tax (Rate) dated 28.06.2017 SI. No 66, which exempts services provided by an educational institution to its students, faculty and staff.

Notification No. 11/2017-Central Tax (Rate) dated 28.06.2017, SI. No. 7(i) prescribes GST rate of $5 \%$ on supply of food and beverages services.

Explanation 1 to the said entry states that such supply can take place at canteen, mess, cafeteria of an institution such as school, college, hospitals etc. On the other hand, Notification No. 12/2017-Central Tax (Rate), SI. No. 66 (a) exempts services provided by an educational institution to its students, faculty and staff.

There is no conflict between the two entries. Entries in Notification No. 11/2017-Central Tax (Rate) prescribing GST rates on service have to be read together with entries in exemption Notification No. 12/2017-Central Tax (Rate) dated 28.06.2017.

A supply which is specifically covered by any entry of Notification No. 12/2017-Central Tax (Rate) dated 28-06-2017 is exempt from GST notwithstanding the fact that GST rate has been prescribed for the same under Notification No. 11/2017-Central Tax (Rate) dated 28.06.2017.

Supply of all services by an educational institution to its students, faculty and staff is exempt under Notification No. 12/2017-Central Tax (Rate) dated 28.06.2017, SI. No. 66. Such services include supply of food and beverages by an educational institution to its students, faculty and staff. As stated in explanation 3 (ii) to Notification No. 12/2017-Central Tax (Rate) dated 28.06.2017 Chapter, Section, Heading, Group or Service Codes mentioned in column (2) of the table in Notification No. 12/2017-Central Tax (Rate) dated 28.06.2017 are only indicative.

Accordingly, it is clarified that supply of food and beverages by an educational institution to its students, faculty and staff, where such supply is made by the educational institution itself, is exempt under Notification No. 12/2017-Central Tax (Rate) dated 28.06.2017, vide SI. No. 66 w.e.f. 01-07-2017 itself.

However, such supply of food and beverages by any person other than the educational institutions based on a contractual arrangement with such institution is leviable to GST@ 5\%.

In order to remove any doubts on the issue, Explanation 1 to Entry 7(i) of Notification No. 11/2017-Central Tax (Rate) dated 28.06.2017 has been amended vide Notification No. 27/2018-Central Tax (Rate) dated 31.12.2018 to omit from it the words "school, college".

Further, heading 9963 has been added in Column (2) against entry at SI. No. 66 of Notification No. 12/2017-Central Tax (Rate) dated 28.06.2017, vide Notification No. 28/2018-Central Tax (Rate) dated 31.12.2018.

## Date - $1^{\text {st }}$ January 2019

GST on Services of Business Facilitator (BF) or a Business Correspondent (BC) to Banking Company.

Representations have been received seeking clarification on following two issues:
(i) What is the value to be adopted for the purpose of computing GST on services provided by BF/BC to a banking company?
(ii) What is the scope of services provided by BF/BC to a banking company with respect to accounts in its rural area branch

that are eligible for existing GST exemption?
The above matter has been clarified as under-
Issue 1: Clarification on value of services by BF/BC to a banking company:
As per RBI's Circular No. DBOD.No.BL.BC. 58/22.01.001/2005-2006 dated 25.01.2006 and subsequent instructions on the issue (referred to as 'guidelines' hereinafter), banks may pay reasonable commission/fee to the BC, the rate and quantum of which may be reviewed periodically. The agreement of banks with the BC specifically prohibits them from directly charging any fee to the customers for services rendered by them on behalf of the bank.

On the other hand, banks (and not BCs) are permitted to collect reasonable service charges from the customers for such service in a transparent manner. The arrangements of banks with the Business Correspondents specify the requirement that the transactions are accounted for and reflected in the bank's books by end of the day or the next working day, and all agreements/ contracts with the customer shall clearly specify that the bank is responsible to the customer for acts of omission and commission of the Business Facilitator/Correspondent.

Hence, banking company is the service provider in the business facilitator model or the business correspondent model operated by a banking company as per RBI guidelines. The banking company is liable to pay GST on the entire value of service charge or fee charged to customers whether or not received via business facilitator or the business correspondent.

Issue 2: Clarification on the scope of services by BF/BC to a banking company with respect to accounts in rural areas:

It has also been requested that the scope of exemption to services provided in relation to "accounts in its rural area branch" vide SI. No. 39 of Notification No. 12/2017- Central Tax (Rate) dated 28.06.2017 be clarified. This clarification has been requested as the exemption from tax on services provided by BF/BC is dependent on the meaning of the expression "accounts in its rural area branch".

It is clarified that for the purpose of availing exemption from GST under SI. No. 39 of said notification, the conditions flowing from the language of the notification should be satisfied. These conditions are that the services provided by a BF/BC to a banking company in their respective individual capacities should fall under the Heading 9971 and that such services should be with respect to accounts in a branch located in the rural area of the banking company. The procedure for classification of branch of a bank as located in rural area and the services which can be provided by BF/BC, is governed by the RBI guidelines. Therefore, classification adopted by the bank in terms of RBI guidelines in this regard should be accepted.

A registered supplier is required to mention the details of inter -State supplies made to unregistered persons, composition taxable persons and UIN holders in Table 3.2 of FORM GSTR-3B. Further, the details of all interState supplies made to unregistered persons where the invoice value is up to Rs 2.5 lakhs (rate-wise) are required to be reported in Table 7B of FORM GSTR-1.

It has been noticed that a number of registered persons have not reported the details of Inter-State supplies made to unregistered persons in Table 3.2 of FORM GSTR-3B. However, the said details have been mentioned in Table 7B of FORM GSTR-1. In order to ensure uniformity in the implementation of the provisions of law across the field formations, the Board has issued the following instructions.

- It is pertinent to mention that apportionment of IGST collected on inter-State supplies made to unregistered persons in the State where such supply takes place is based on the information reported in Table 3.2 of FORM GSTR-3B by the registered person. As such, non-mentioning of the said information results in -
  (i) non-apportionment of the due amount of IGST to the State where such supply takes place; and

(ii) a mis-match in the quantum of goods or services or both actually supplied in a State and the amount of integrated tax apportioned between the Centre and that State, and consequent non-compliance of sub-section (2) of section 17 of the Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017.

Accordingly, it is instructed that the registered persons making inter-State supplies to unregistered persons shall report the details of such supplies along with the place of supply in Table 3.2 of FORM GSTR-3B and Table 7B of FORM GSTR-1 as mandated by the law.

Seeks to give clarification regarding tax payment made for supply of warehoused goods while being deposited in a customs bonded warehouse for the period July, 2017 to March, 2018.

The applicability of integrated tax on goods transferred/sold while being deposited in a warehouse (hereinafter referred to as the "warehoused goods") was clarified in Circular No. 3/1/2018-IGST dated 25.05.2018. According to that circular, it has been described that from 1st of April, 2018 the supply of warehoused goods before their clearance from the warehouse would not be subject to the levy of integrated tax.

It has been noticed that during the period from 1st of July, 2017 to 31st of March, 2018 ,the common portal did not have the facility to enable the taxpayer to report payment of integrated tax, in the details required to be submitted in FORM GSTR-1, for such supplies especially where the supplier and the recipient were located in the same State or Union territory.

Hence taxpayers making such supplies have reported such supplies as intra-State supplies and discharged central tax and state tax instead of integrated tax accordingly.

In order to ensure uniformity in the implementation of the provisions of law across the field formations, the Board has issued the following instructions.

Supply of warehoused goods while deposited in custom bonded warehouses had the character of inter-State supply as per the provisions of Integrated Goods and Services tax Act, 2017. But, due to non-availability of the facility on the common portal, suppliers have reported such supplies as intra-State supplies and discharged central tax and state tax on such supplies instead of integrated tax.

In view of revenue neutral position of such tax payment and that facility to correctly report the nature of transaction in FORM GSTR-1 furnished on the common portal was not available during the period July, 2017 to March, 2018, it has been decided that, as a one-time exception, suppliers who have paid central tax and state tax on such supplies, during the said period, would be deemed to have complied with the provisions of law as far as payment of tax on such supplies is concerned as long as the amount of tax paid as central tax and state tax is equal to the due amount of integrated tax on

Circular clarifying various doubts related to treatment of sales promotion scheme under GST

There are several promotional schemes which are offered by taxable persons to increase sales volume and to attract new customers for their products.

Various representations have been received seeking clarification on issues raised with respect to tax treatment of sales promotion schemes under GST.

In this regard, some of these schemes have been examined and clarification on the aspects of taxability, valuation, availability or otherwise of Input Tax Credit in the hands of the supplier are explained hereunder.

## Free samples and gifts:

The goods or services or both which are supplied at free of cost (without any consideration) shall not be treated as „supply $\square$ under GST (except in case of activities mentioned in Schedule I of the said Act). Accordingly, the samples which are supplied free of cost, without any consideration, do not qualify as „supply $\square$ under GST, except where the activity falls within the ambit of Schedule I of the said Act.

ITC shall not be available in respect of goods lost, stolen, destroyed, written off or disposed of by way of gift or free samples. Thus, it is clarified that input tax credit shall not be available to the supplier on the inputs, input services and capital goods to the extent they are used in relation to the gifts or free samples distributed without any consideration. However, where the activity of distribution of gifts or free samples falls within the scope of "supply $\square$ on account of the provisions contained in Schedule I of the said Act, the supplier would be eligible to avail of the ITC.

## Buy one get one free offer:

Sometimes, companies announce offers like 'Buy One, Get One free $\square$. This is not an individual supply of free goods but a case of two or more individual supplies where a single price is being charged for the entire supply. It can at best be treated as supplying two goods for the price of one.

Taxability of such supply will be dependent upon as to whether the supply is a composite supply or a mixed supply and the rate of tax shall be determined as per the provisions of section 8 of the said Act.

It is also clarified that ITC shall be available to the supplier for the inputs, input services and capital goods used in relation to supply of goods or services or both as part of such offers.

Discounts including 'Buy more, save more' offers

Sometimes, the supplier offers staggered discount to his customers (increase in discount rate with increase in purchase volume). Such discounts are shown on the invoice itself.

Some suppliers also offer periodic / year ending discounts to their stockists, etc. Such discounts are passed on by the supplier through credit notes.

It is clarified that discounts offered by the suppliers to customers (including staggered discount under „Buy more, save more scheme and post supply / volume discounts established before or at the time of supply) shall be excluded to determine the value of supply provided they satisfy the parameters laid down in sub-section (3) of section 15 of the said Act, including the reversal of ITC by the recipient of the supply as is attributable to the discount on the basis of document (s) issued by the supplier.

It is further clarified that the supplier shall be entitled to avail the ITC for such inputs, input services and capital goods used in relation to the supply of goods or services or both on such discounts.

# Secondary Discounts

These are the discounts which are not known at the time of supply or are offered after the supply is already over.

Secondary discounts shall not be excluded while determining the value of supply as such discounts are not known at the time of supply and the conditions laid down in clause (b) of sub-section (3) of section 15 of the said Act are not satisfied.

There is no impact on availability or otherwise of ITC in the hands of supplier in this case.

It is further clarified that nature of supply of PSLC between banks may be treated as a supply of goods in the course of inter-State trade or commerce. Accordingly, IGST shall be payable on the supply of PSLC traded over e-Kuber portal of RBI for both periods i.e 01.07 .2017 to 27.05 .2018 and from 28.05.2018 onwards. However, where the bank liable to pay GST has already paid CGST/SGST or CGST/UTGST as the case may be, such banks for payment already made, shall not be required to pay IGST towards such supply.

| Certain registered persons have reversed, through return in FORM GSTR-3B filed for the month of August, 2018 or for a subsequent month, the accumulated input tax credit (ITC) required to be lapsed in terms of notification No. 20/2018- Central Tax (Rate) dated 26.07.2018 read with circular No. 56/30/2018-GST dated 24.08.2018.Some of these registered persons, who have attempted to claim refund of accumulated ITC on account of inverted tax structure for the same period in which the ITC required to be lapsed in terms of the said notification has been reversed, are not able to claim refund of accumulated ITC to the extent to which they are so eligible. This is because of a validation check on the common portal which prevents the value of input tax credit in Statement IA of FORM GST RFD-01Afrom being higher than the amount of ITC availed in FORM GSTR-3B of the relevant period minus the value of ITC reversed in the same period. This results in registered persons being unable to claim the full amount of refund of accumulated ITC on account of inverted tax structure to which they might be otherwise eligible. What is the solution to this problem? | a) As a one-time measure to resolve this issue, refund of accumulated ITC on account of inverted tax structure, for the period(s) in which there is reversal of the ITC required to be lapsed in terms of the said notification, is to be claimed under the category "any other" instead of under the category "refund of unutilized ITC on account of accumulation due to inverted tax structure" in FORM GST RFD-01A. It is emphasized that this application for refund should relate to the same tax period in which such reversal has been made. |

|  | b) The application shall be accompanied by all statements, declarations, undertakings and other documents which are statutorily required to be submitted with a "refund claim of unutilized ITC on account of accumulation due to inverted tax structure". On receiving the said application, the proper officer shall himself calculate the refund amount admissible as per rule 89(5) of Central Goods and Services Tax Rules, 2017 (hereinafter referred to as "CGST Rules"), in the manner detailed in para 3 of Circular No. 59/33/2018-GST dated 04.09.2018. After calculating the admissible refund amount, as described above, and scrutinizing the application for completeness and eligibility, if the proper officer is satisfied that the whole or any part of the amount claimed is payable as refund, he shall request the taxpayer, in writing, to debit the said amount from his electronic credit ledger through FORM GST DRC-03. Once the proof of such debit is received by the proper officer, he shall proceed to issue the refund order in FORM GST RFD-06 and the payment advice in FORM GST RFD-05. c) All refund applications for unutilized ITC on account of accumulation due to inverted tax structure for subsequent tax period(s) shall be filed in FORM GST RFD-01A under the category "refund of unutilized ITC on account of accumulation due to inverted tax structure". |

Recently, a large number of registrations have been cancelled by the

proper officer under the provisions of sub-section (2) of section 29 of the Central Goods and Services Act, 2017 read with rule 21 of the Central Goods and Services Rules, 2017 on account of noncompliance of the said statutory provisions.

In this regard, instances have come to notice that such persons, who continue to carry on business and therefore are required to have registration under GST, are not applying for revocation of cancellation of registration as specified in section 30 of the CGST Act read with rule 23 of the CGST Rules.

Instead, such persons are applying for fresh registration. Such new applications might have been made as such person may not have furnished requisite returns and not paid tax for the tax periods covered under the old/cancelled registration. Further, such persons would be required to pay all liabilities due from them for the relevant period in case they apply for revocation of cancellation of registration.

Hence, to avoid payment of the tax liabilities, such persons may be using the route of applying for fresh registration. It is pertinent to mention that as per the provisions contained in proviso to sub-section (2) of section 25 of the CGST Act, a person may take separate registration on same PAN in the same State.

Section 49 was amended and Section 49A and Section 49B were inserted vide Central Goods and Services Tax (Amendment) Act, 2018 which came into effect from 1st February 2019.

In order to ensure uniformity in the implementation of the provisions of the law, the Board, has clarified the issues raised as below-
(1) The newly inserted Section 49A of the CGST Act provides that the input tax credit of Integrated tax has to be utilized completely before input tax credit of Central tax / State tax can be utilized for discharge of any tax liability. Further, as per the provisions of section 49 of the CGST Act, credit of Integrated tax has to be utilized first for payment of Integrated tax, then Central tax and then State tax in that order mandatorily. This led to a situation, in certain cases, where a taxpayer has to discharge his tax liability on account of one type of tax (say State tax) through electronic cash ledger, while the input tax credit on account of other type of tax (say Central tax) remains un-utilized in electronic credit ledger.

Registration of several persons was cancelled under sub-section (2) of

section 29 of the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 due to nonfurnishing of returns in FORM GSTR-3B or FORM GSTR-4. Sub-section (2) of section 29 of the said Act empowers the proper officer to cancel the registration, including from a retrospective date. Thus registration have been cancelled either from the date of order of cancellation of registration or from a retrospective date.

Representations have been received that large number of persons whose registration were cancelled could not apply for revocation of the said cancellation of registration within the period of 30 days as provided in subsection (1) of section 30 of the said Act.

Accordingly, a Removal of Difficulty Order (RoD) number 05/2019-Central Tax dated the 23rd April, 2019 has been issued wherein persons whose registrations have been cancelled under sub-section (2) of section 29 of the said Act after they were served notice in the manner and who could not reply to the said notice and for whom cancellation order has been passed up to 31st March, 2019, have been given one time opportunity to apply for revocation of cancellation of registration on or before the 22nd July, 2019. Further, vide Notification No. 20/2019-Central Tax, dated the 23rd April, 2019.

First proviso to sub-rule (1) of rule 23 of the said Rules provides that if the registration has been cancelled on account of failure of the registered person to furnish returns, no application for revocation of cancellation of registration shall be filed, unless such returns are furnished and any amount in terms of such returns is paid.

Thus, where the registration has been cancelled with effect from the date of order of cancellation of registration, all returns due till the date of such cancellation are required to be furnished before the application for revocation can be filed.

Further, in such cases, in terms of the second proviso to sub-rule (1) of rule 23 of the said Rules, all returns required to be furnished in respect of the period from the date of order of cancellation till the date of order of revocation of cancellation of registration have to be furnished within a period of 30 days from the date of the order of revocation.

Where the registration has been cancelled with retrospective effect, the common portal does not allow furnishing of returns after the effective date of cancellation. In such cases it was not possible to file the application for revocation of cancellation of registration.

Therefore, a third proviso was added to sub-rule (1) of rule 23 of the said Rules enabling filing of application for revocation of cancellation of registration, subject to the condition that all returns relating to the period from the effective date of cancellation of registration till the date of order of revocation of cancellation of registration shall be filed within a period of 30 days from the date of order of such revocation of cancellation of registration.

## GST Applicability on Seed Certification Tags

Representations have been received by the Board seeking clarification regarding applicability of GST on supply of Seed Certification Tags. Reference in this regard has also been received from the State of Tamil Nadu.

The matter has been examined. It is seen that the process of seed testing and certification followed in the state of Tamil Nadu, as prescribed in the Seeds Act, 1966 and elaborated in the Manual on Seed Production and Certification, published by Centre for Indian Knowledge Systems, Chennai, involves the following steps:

## Application for seed production

Any person who wants to take up certified seed production should submit a sowing report in triplicate to the Assistant Director of Seed Certification to register the crop and season with a registration fee of Rs. 25/- (Rupees twenty-five only) and prescribed certification charges. The fee is for a single crop variety for an area up to 25 acres and for a single season.

## Registration of sowing report

After receiving the application of the sowing report, the Assistant Director of Seed Certification scrutinizes and registers the seed farm and duly assigns a Seed certification number for each sowing report.

## Field inspection

Field inspections to check for the factors that may affect the genetic purity and physical health of the seeds are conducted by the Seed Certification Officer (SCO) to whom the specific seed farm has been allocated. Number of field inspections differ from crop to crop. Generally field inspections are carried out during the following growth stages of the crop.
(1) Pre flowering stage
(1) Flowering stage
(1) Post flowering and Pre harvest stage
(1) Harvest time

## Seed processing

Once the seeds are harvested from the seed farm by following the required field standards, it is taken to the approved seed processing units. Each seed lot should accompany the processing report and each seed lot in the unit is verified with this report. Processing includes cleaning, drying, grading, treating and other operations to improve the seed quality. Seed Certification Officer inspects the processing plant to check the possibility of mechanical mixtures.

# Seed sampling and analysis

Seed sample should be sent to the seed testing laboratory for analysis through the Assistant Director of Seed Certification. The fee of Rs.30/(Rupees thirty only) for seed analysis should be paid during the registration of the seed farm. To analyse the genetic purity of the seed sample, the producer should pay a fee of Rs. 200/- (Rupees two hundred only) to the Assistant Director of Seed Certification. Seed lots which meet the prescribed seed standards like purity, free of inert matter, moisture percentage and germination capacity alone will be allotted the certification label. White colour label for foundation seeds and blue colour label for certified seeds should be bought from the Assistant Director of Seed Certification by paying Rs. 3/- and Rs. 2/- respectively.

## Tagging and sealing

Approved seed lots should be tagged with certification tag within two months from the date of the receipt of seed analysis report or within 30 days from the date of genetic purity test performed. On receipt of the seed tags, it is verified by the Seed Certification Officer. All the prescribed details are entered in the tag without any omission. The green colour ( 10 - 15 cm size) producer tag should also be attached to the seed lot along with the certification tag. Avoid stitching more than once on the tags. All the tagging operations should be done in the presence of the Seed Certification Officer. If tagging has not been done within the specific time limit, confirmation samples can be taken with prior permission from the Assistant Director of Seed Certification. In such cases the validity of the seed lot will be fixed from the initial date of seed analysis and tagged. The fee for the delayed tagging is Rs. 50/- (Rupees fifty only) and seed analysis fee of Rs. 30/- (Rupees thirty only) has to be paid in such cases.
